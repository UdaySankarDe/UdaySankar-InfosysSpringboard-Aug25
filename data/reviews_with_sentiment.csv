The comfort level is outstanding—even after hours of wearing them, there’s no discomfort or pressure on my ears. The ear cushions are soft, and the fit feels just right without being too tight.

The sound quality is phenomenal. The clarity is crisp, and the bass is deep but not overwhelming. Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or watching movies, everything sounds immersive and well-balanced. Noise isolation is also excellent, allowing me to focus without distractions.

If you’re looking for headphones that excel in both comfort and audio performance, these are a perfect choice. Highly recommended!",2024-11-14,5,5.0,https://amazon.in/HAMMER-Bash-Max-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B0CBFYNWWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RGEV3G341VI32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBFYNWWG#RGEV3G341VI32,2025-01-11T21:03:13.215629,Positive,0.9767078757286072
"HAMMER Bash Max Over The Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Touch Control, Deep Bass, Upto 40 Hours Playtime, Bluetooth 5.3, Workout/Travel (Apricot)",B0CBFYNWWG,R1ASCQM7HWPVTO,Honest Review: Hammer Blash Max - Premium Performance at an Unbeatable Price.,Aryan chandrakant Waghmale,"I've been using the Hammer Blash Max headphones for a month, and they’re honestly a hidden gem. The sound quality is absolutely incredible – rich, deep, and crystal clear. The mic performs great, making calls smooth, and the sound isolation helps me stay focused on my studies. As a student, it's a perfect choice, especially when compared to brands like Noise or BoAt in the same price range. The premium feel of these headphones really stands out.

What really sets the Blash Max apart is the design. The 180-degree rotation ensures they stay safe from damage when not in use, unlike other headsets that can break or tilt. The soft cushions and matte finish make long online classes and study sessions comfortable. Plus, they're ideal for outdoor activities, traveling, and gym workouts – they won’t fall off like buds, which is a huge bonus. Covering the full ear, they provide a much better experience than typical on-ear headphones.

The build quality is fantastic, and the customer support team is quick and responsive if you ever need assistance. The only slight drawback is the charging time, but once charged, the call quality is premium and clear, and the music is immersive. What really impressed me is the touch controls – something you rarely find in other brands at this price. If you're looking for a durable, stylish, and functional headset, the Hammer Blash Max is the way to go!",2024-11-27,4,2.0,https://amazon.in/HAMMER-Bash-Max-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B0CBFYNWWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1ASCQM7HWPVTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBFYNWWG,2025-01-11T21:03:13.215629,Positive,0.9848987460136414

Having contacted call centre their reply is ""in this type of issues are not repairable"". Being a tropical weather country with relatively high humidty this wear & tear is normal for which maufacturer ought to have made provisions for cushion replacement at reasonable cost. It is understandable that this cannot be covered under warranty as it may be classified under consumables. Nevertheless manufacturer shouldn't deny repair at all. What's even more frustrating is that they don't have pan India service support. Only service centre is in Haryana.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently purchased the Boat headphones, and I couldn't be happier with my choice! From the moment I unboxed them, the quality was evident. The design is sleek and comfortable, perfect for long listening sessions. The sound quality is impressive, with clear highs and rich bass that really enhances my music experience.

The battery life is outstanding; I’ve been using them for over a week without needing to recharge. They also connect seamlessly to my devices via Bluetooth, and I’ve had no issues with connectivity.

One of my favorite features is the built-in microphone, which makes taking calls super convenient. Overall, these headphones deliver great value for the price, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for quality audio on a budget.

"boAt Rockerz 450, 15 HRS Battery, 40mm Drivers, Padded Ear Cushions, Integrated Controls, Dual Modes, Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Headphone with Mic (Luscious Black)",B07PR1CL3S,RVOGO1S638WLI,Simply Awful,Gizmofreak Reviews,"The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.

1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.
2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.
3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.
5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.
4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save  up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?

The beige colours looks a lot more yellow in person than in images.
- Sound quality : Its about what you can expect from 1.5k headphones, average sound, average bass, for the average person who doesn't care about the little details it's alright.
- Connectivity : Good, I notice some spikes in dissconectivity atleast with my phone, I'll test with other devices and update.
- AUX function : Good
- Build quality : It's made of plastic, can get scratched easily I'd say. Doesn't feel too flimsy nor sturdy either. Be careful with it
- Comfort : It's ON EAR HEADPHONES - what do you expect, it's goanna be pretty bad in terms of comfort. If you are goanna use it for long hours, go for over ear headphones.
- Battery life : It's good, as advertised.
- Size : Good size, can fit people cus it has an adjustable strap
Additional points : Others can kinda hear what you're listening to on high volume, zero noise isolation. Mic is mid

Build quality- It's good for the price very good build but can break if fall or someone sits on it though build quality is great  I am using it very civil manner 😜 so mine one is absolutely fine.2. Noise cancellation- It's just a gimmick do not purchase for noise cancellation they do normal passive noise cancelation but this shouldn't be your purchasing decision for this headphone.3. Bluetooth connectivity- It works absolutely perfect for Mobile, Tab, and smart TV- But with my PC it gets little connectivity issues but that's only for 1 out of 10 times but its Okay as I used it with Aux now Because my usage is high4. Battery- It was by buying decision for this headphone I purchase it for my online classes as I need great battery life and this headphone done this job absolutely perfect I got 17-18 hours of battery on the usage at sound 70% and its great believe me big battery life is must for any Bluetooth device and it's been 10 months now it's the battery is degraded as I was heavy user now it gives around 13-15 hour. so I recommend to use it with AUX if you are going to use it for a very long period it will save your battery5. Sound quality- I purchase it for battery life and I thought sound quality will be okay and it doesn't matter to me as I will be using it for classes but I was wrong the sound quality is soo good u will find this level of sound quality in the expensive headphone for the sound quality it's 10/10.6. Now some prons that pissed me of- It got an issue only with PC while connecting I have to connect and disconnect more than 3 times. but there can be Issues with my PC also IDK because this problem only happen with PC only work fine on another device- After connecting it with AUX headphone buttons and the mic doesn't work it only works on Bluetooth mode and it totally ruins the experience with AUX u can only use it for listening with AUX, not for Video calls, normal calls, and online multiplayer game Like pubg as mic doesn't work so U have to connect it Bluetooth to unlock all these features- U can't use it in summers if u have no AC in your room U will end up with lots of sweat if You use It so consider this also because If you're going to use it in a room without AC and u are living in a city like Delhi then don't purchase it.",2021-12-07,4,54.0,https://amazon.in/Boat-Rockerz-550-Headphone-Aesthetics/dp/B0856HY85J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3VXSMZ7Z5YFX5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0856HY85J,2025-01-11T21:25:36.395662,Positive,0.6395928263664246

The sponge covering torn of completely after 1 year of usage and one side of the headphone broke while taking them  off my head, Really like the audio quality. One more thing I like to include is the charging port, it's built very loosely, you have to bend the whole cable and keep it tight near the port to charge.Pros: Audio quality is just awesome, u can use these headphones while listening to music ans gaming(with aux cable) too.It's is really comfortable near the ears and ear doesn't hurts after 5-6hrs of continuous usage. Battery life is also good I used to charge once in 4-6days and mostly used bluetooth.I did paired(Bluetooth only) it with my laptop and mobile at same time but headphones only process one device sound at a time so I had to mute other time to time to shift onto devices. So u have to manage this thing.It pairs with device easily without any issue or without taking much time. The aux cable is good too not too tight or too loose just perfect.Head adjustment mechanism is kinda funny because the headphones moves side to side faster when u take headphones out of adjustment idk why, could be less friction.While gaming with aux cable on u can get 0 latency(no sound delay) and can differentiate between lefts and rights and it's really helpful.I don't know the weight of headphones but they feels light on head so u can play games or watch movies without headacheCons: Build quality, full plastic body with only metal strip on head adjustment band and the plastic quality is ok ok...(cuz it broke ;-;).Charging port is loosely fitted so you have to sacrifice your cable life span.Cushion are comfy but the skin or we say covering starts to fall off after some time and the headphones looks like dog water.High latency in Bluetooth mode making it use aux cable while gaming only and if u dont have aux cable port in your device so just quit these headphones and look for something else.Looks too big on head so won't recommend for gym, walk usage.You came across whole review so here's ur cookie 🍪!",2024-10-05,3,13.0,https://amazon.in/Boat-Rockerz-550-Headphone-Aesthetics/dp/B0856HY85J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1NDWHXCEYX5LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0856HY85J,2025-01-11T21:25:36.395662,Positive,0.7528210282325745

I bought this piece in March 2022. It was at a good price then. I bought it for gaming and listening music. This headset is the best one I could recommend to anyone.After 2 years, I have no complaint against this device. This device is the best at its price range. The only downside I experienced is1. Feels a little discomfort after wearing for long time.2. The sound is fading very slowly after 2 successful years. Looks like it's dying. When I bought this device 100% volume is so high that it could break your eardrum so I used to listen it at 50%. Now, 100% volume seems like 20 - 40% volume.3. When at 100% volume, hearing a song feels bit awkward like it seems to have some disturbance. We may feel disturbed.But 80% volume is nice, decent, and best for it's price. Nice bass not best but decent.4. When I bought this device, the mic was pretty good. But now after 2 years, while recording or talking, my voice may feel shattered or breaking in between. Maybe because it's too old. But as a new one, you may not experience anything.Overall, it's a budget friendly, good headset  for everyone.

The ear cups and headband are made of plastic, but they feel sturdy and durable. The ear cups are also padded with soft memory foam, which makes them comfortable to wear for long periods of time.Sound qualityThe BassHeads 900 produce a good overall sound quality. The mids and highs are clear and detailed, and the bass is present but not overpowering. However, the bass is not as deep or punchy as some other headphones in this price range.Mic and noise cancellationThe mic on the BassHeads 900 is poor. It is difficult to understand your voice on calls, and it picks up a lot of background noise. The noise cancellation on the BassHeads 900 is also poor. It does not block out much background noise, so you will still be able to hear traffic, people talking, and other noises when listening to music or podcasts.OverallThe boAt BassHeads 900 are a good pair of budget-friendly wired on-ear headphones.

Samsung level u has the least bass compared to the other 2In terms of audio quality, the boat bass heads and Samsung level u are in the same level, the clarity of sound is a bit less in the ant audio w56 compared to the boat .For outdoor use, I would prefer the ant audio w56 as it has better noice cancellation compared to the boat.ComfortI have read some reviews complaining about the boat bass heads 900 that it pains in the ears after a few minutes of usage. But I have not experienced such problems.Build qualityThe plastics used is not the best, but acceptable.

Rating: 1/5

I recently purchased the Airdopes Progear, expecting a high-quality audio experience. Unfortunately, this product has been a major letdown.

Poor Sound Quality:

The sound quality is subpar, lacking depth and clarity. The audio is tinny, with no noticeable bass. Even at maximum volume, the sound remains weak and unimpressive.

Key Issues:

1. No Bass: The absence of bass is staggering. Music and videos lack the punch and energy that bass provides.
2. Distortion: Audio distortion is noticeable, especially at higher volumes.
3. Muffled Sound: Voices and instruments sound muffled, lacking definition.
4. Unimpressive Treble: The treble is overpowering, making the overall sound unbalanced.

Design and Comfort:

While the design is sleek and compact, comfort is compromised. The earbuds feel bulky, causing discomfort during extended wear.

Battery Life:

Battery life is average, lasting around 4-5 hours on a single charge.

Connectivity:

Bluetooth connectivity is stable, but pairing can be finicky at times.

Conclusion:

The Airdopes Progear failed to meet my expectations. With poor sound quality, lack of bass, and uncomfortable design, I wouldn't recommend this product.

*Final Verdict:*

Avoid the Airdopes Progear if you prioritize sound quality. Invest in better alternatives for an immersive audio experience.",2024-11-14,1,25.0,https://amazon.in/boAt-Airdopes-Progear-Open-Ear-Conduction/dp/B0D7MR3HVP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RXOTLQJV8XIWZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7MR3HVP,2025-01-11T21:49:08.761838,Negative,0.9404025673866272

I love that I can still hear what’s happening around me, which is great when I’m out jogging or biking. The fit is secure, so they don’t fall out, even when moving around a lot. They’re also sweat-resistant, so they hold up well during workouts.

The sound quality is surprisingly good, with a nice bass kick, and calls are clear, even when I’m in a noisy place. The battery life is amazing—I’ve gone days without needing to charge them, and even if the battery’s low, a quick 10-minute charge gives you hours of playtime. The Bluetooth connects quickly and stays connected without any fuss, so it’s been really convenient.

There’s also this gaming mode that reduces the lag, which is cool for watching videos or gaming without that annoying delay.

1.Very comfortable to wear all day long.
2. Light weight. Feel nahi hota kaan pr laga hua hai.
3. Keeps one fully aware of surroundings. Logon se aaram se baat kr sakte ho.
4. Decent battery backup. Lasts for around 12 hours. Can be used on one ear at a time. So usable time can be extended upto 50 hours with charging.
5. Sound quality is good. Though don't expect exceptional bass and treble (obviously) as it doesn't go inside ear canal and hence no chances of ear infection and irritation.
6. Great for working people.
Dislikes:
1. Uncomfortable to wear inside helmet
2. Cannot be used while riding 2 wheelers due to wind noise.
3. Touch functions not good. I prefer buttons.
4. Outside noise is a very big problem as it's based on open air conduction. So no question of any kind of noise cancellation.
5. Mic reception is weak for noisy places.

This is my first HEADphone. Ive till date used wired earphones and neckbands.

The sound quality and bass have surprised me. This is a 7 day review
At 1300, I would buy it anytime. It so freaking good.
The plastic build is also quite nice. Gives a very decent look.
My head is a little big , but then too fits perfectly. The cushion quality is also very comfortable.
The Bluetooth connection is also good and considerably fast.
Played COD(without aux) and its truely 40ms latency. So kudos in that area too.
Love it

Drawbacks -
little problem with the aux wire. The wired connection is okay.

This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.

1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.
2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.
3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.
5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.
4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save  up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?

The beige colours looks a lot more yellow in person than in images.
- Sound quality : Its about what you can expect from 1.5k headphones, average sound, average bass, for the average person who doesn't care about the little details it's alright.
- Connectivity : Good, I notice some spikes in dissconectivity atleast with my phone, I'll test with other devices and update.
- AUX function : Good
- Build quality : It's made of plastic, can get scratched easily I'd say. Doesn't feel too flimsy nor sturdy either. Be careful with it
- Comfort : It's ON EAR HEADPHONES - what do you expect, it's goanna be pretty bad in terms of comfort. If you are goanna use it for long hours, go for over ear headphones.
- Battery life : It's good, as advertised.
- Size : Good size, can fit people cus it has an adjustable strap
Additional points : Others can kinda hear what you're listening to on high volume, zero noise isolation. Mic is mid

Should you buy it?
If you desperately need a headphone and don't trust zebronics, then sure. Otherwise, please please don't make the mistake and cheap out on stuff you will wear on your head for hours.

"Sony MDR-ZX110A On-Ear Stereo Headphones (White), without mic",B00KGZZ824,R2851XLH169VCA,Review after 4 YEARS of usage,SURYANSH,"Okay.... Let me get this straight.... I havent been using this headset for straight up 4 years... I have tried many a headphones and in-ears after this... But for the first 2 years i had no other choice but to use it..... I still use it every now and again these days.... And that should make my review CLEAR as i will give you all of the the wholistic view of the headphones...(MIDRANGE ONLY-audiophiles dont laugh) (ONLY HEAVY READERS MAY READ THIS WHOLE... BUT I WILL TRY TO MAKE IT AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE)For me i have tried BOAT in-ears which come around 599 or 499, JBL heasets which come around 799....and currently Jabra smart halo which was given to me.... Price is around 5000-7000.... Bluetooth headsetNow starting the review.... You must have read the above review and gotten a general idea of the sound quality and its lightweightedness...OKAY these are REALLY LIGHT and COMFY headsets... It doesnt clamp onto your ears like other on-ear headsets...PORTABILITY is on par.... The build is such that it could be folded and there are no useless curves so you can throw them into your bag and do not worry about it being crushed...The third is the main and its the SOUND QUALITY... damn... I am still shocked till this day... How were they able to pack these sounding drivers in there.... And the fact that it was available to me 4 hears ago... Probably lower than this price... I got it for Rs.499 which is just a total steal..... The sound is kinda FLAT.... And if you are a PROPER LISTENER... this is obviously a PLUS POINT.... It has a SOUND SIGNATURE very pleasing to hear and should not build up TENSION and ADRENALIN in the moments where you just want to.... SLEEP...... or relax.... Also somewhat FLAT signature lets you listen to the song the way it was meant to be BY THE ARTIST...Also the sound is WIDE...It doesnt feel that the sound is only playing inside your head... YEAH it is pretty much the best SOUND STAGE you can get at this priceNow before you get too excited... Let me throw to you some of its defects in sound like a saucy villian MUAHAHAHA.... FIRST is that of its loose fit....yea it fits nicely but after 8 to 10 months these becomes kinda loose... So the volume decreases... Doesnt effect the SOUND QUALITY though....Second is bad... But not for all...it is that it has a LOW VOLUME.... If you want to listen to high volume music.... This headphones doesnt go that far... You may be able to increase it through some apps...but it is not that high from default....Third is the NOISE-CANCELLATION.... These have almost no noise cancellation... So if you are in a loud environment... You may hear the music but only with the rumbles of the real world....(For me it is not a disadvantage as i hate noise cancellation but for many it is so I added)The FOURTH is the REAL DEPTH in sound.... Although the sound is organic... But the depth in the sound is really low.... In ears have a greater depth compared to headphones...IN CONCLUSION.... If your budget is under 700...definately get this one for comfort and relaxation... If you are a ADRENALIN JUNKIE... get an in-ear...those go up monstrous in volumes and bass...Also i think i dont need to write about DURABILTY....its been freaking 4 years and i havent had a single issue of time with this thing....Thats all for now folks...THNX FOR READING....and damn you are a heavy reader.... I owe you one",2019-02-28,4,317.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-MDR-ZX110A-Stereo-Headphones-without/dp/B00KGZZ824/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2851XLH169VCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGZZ824,2025-01-11T21:53:10.068018,Neutral,0.47127094864845276
"Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery-Blue",B0BS1RT9S2,R1FROBSTZ2XO80,Are they worth the price in 2024 - Detailed review,SREEKUMAR,"So if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read. I know it's somewhat lengthy :( but if you've already bought this pair, skip to the last part, that is, bonus.

Sound quality:-
Pretty good. As you might know, Sony is Sony when it comes to sound. The audio is clear and has that calm, balanced profile that I prefer to the bass oriented profiles of BoAt and JBL. If you are a basshead, I don't think these headphones will be your go to. But if you've been using bass heavy headphones, you will feel and instant change in audio quality and the overall beauty of music once you switch to a Sony device. Keep in mind that I'm not a professional audiophile or something. I love listening to quality music and watching movies and these headphones are perfect. I use Apple music and the sound is bliss, idk about Spotify though but I think it will fare equally well. I like bass and these headphones do provide bass, just that they are not overkill and distort the entire sound looking for it. These feel more premium in the sound department. However some people might feel a lack of excitement in their sound out of the box. Worry not, I've added an EQ tweak to fix your problem at the end of this review.

Specs:-
 30mm drivers. So not as loud as the 40mm ones BoAt and JBL offer in this price range. But I've felt (personally) the audio quality to be better. Bluetooth 5.2 which is solid. Multipoint connection makes sure that this will not be outdated soon. They've been released in 2023 and will remain in contention for atleast a couple of years. Multipoint has to be turned on in headphones app and I use it to connect the headphones to my Macbook to watch movies and to my android phone, which might be on charging or in another room, to attend calls. The switching is seamless and works well. They don't have touch controls though, so it will take a couple of tries to learn to get the buttons right, especially in a dark room. They have DSEE which is basically a feature to enhance low quality/ compressed audios downloaded from internet. It has to be turned on in the app and is not needed for Spotify or Apple music as they are already best quality music and DSEE takes up additional battery charge. Battery is solid. They were 70% out of the box and after 20 hr playback still had 50% left. So I guess they'll last for atleast 50 hrs like they claim on the box. I don't like charging my devices all the time and I use them for max 5 hrs a day for which they will last close to 2 weeks which is good. No ANC though, it's not a problem for me but if it is for you, don't buy. Mic is good, I've attended calls in the midst of traffic and they were pretty fine.

Comfort:-
I've tried many midrange headphones and these are some of the best in terms of comfort too. Soft earcups that sit compact on my ear. However if they are not positioned properly, they might exert pressure. But on proper positioning, they will give 2 to 2.5 hours playback without any discomfort. After that you will have to take a break. I don't have big ears btw. They are lightweight and have an adjustable headband with cushion. So as far as on ear headphones are concerned, these are comfortable.

Build:-
Plastic but feels durable. Not creaking. The earcups are the types which forms wrinkles, they look durable but I don't know if they will pinch unless I use it for atleast 6 months. Anyway these have replacement earcups available online and in Sony service centers. I have one near my house. I don't think they are sweat resistant so don't use it for workouts. For jogging they will stay in place once positioned compactly, but for running they will slip off ear.

Drawbacks:-
Lack of aux cable. Once you are out of charge, that's that. It says they support fast charging on box, but I haven't tried that so idk. Normally takes 2 hours atleast to charge from 20 to 100. Another drawback is portability. They are not foldable and even though the plastic feels durable, I'd suggest you don't bump them much. While travelling either buy a case or carry them around in the box they come with (don't worry about looking cheap, the box doesn't have anything like specs or other bs written on it. Only thing written is Sony. It's inside the white cover that mentions specs).

Conclusion:-
They offer value for money if you ask me. The sound is premium for a budget segment and not too bass oriented. The headphone app means it will get firmware updates and has some listening modes that actually work, it is not a gimmick. They look and feel premium too. And unlike Anker or ATH, they have service centers all over so if any issue pops up, that's an added boost too. The don't have an in box warranty card but worry not, the moment you connect your device to the headphones app they are registered. Keep the Amazon invoice with you, in the box or download it in pdf form from your orders section.

Bonus:-
If the headphones lack excitement to you out of the box, the headphones app offer some preset EQ. But I will share this tweak I found from reddit. They worked for me so if you don't know how to configure the EQ on your own, try this;
Select manual on EQ in Sony headphones app.
Put 400 to 2.
Put 1k to 4.
Put 2.5k to 7.
Put 6.3k to 7.
Put 16k to 5.
Put clear bass to 2.
Try out this tweak and see if it works for you. This works on some higher end Sony models too. Enjoy your headphones!!!",2024-06-26,5,352.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-Bluetooth-Headphones-Multipoint-Connectivity/dp/B0BS1RT9S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1FROBSTZ2XO80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS1RT9S2#R1FROBSTZ2XO80,2025-01-11T21:54:13.874133,Positive,0.6232458353042603

"Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery-Blue",B0BS1RT9S2,R1N00MLWRV8SGE,Value for Money Product with Feature,Piyush Jain,"I recently purchased the Sony WH-CH520 Wireless On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones, and I couldn't be happier with my choice. These headphones have exceeded my expectations in every way!

"Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery-Blue",B0BS1RT9S2,R3PODK5XJLLASD,Amazing!,Tej Prashant Nemane,"The quality feels rich.
The sound is crisp and premium, and even though JBL or boAt alternatives might provide a little more bass in their headsets than this, the sound quality of this one is definitely much better.
Bass isn't everything; the overall sound quality matters, and the bass is sufficient.

The Bluetooth connectivity is amazing.
When I am walking in the house with the phone in one place, the connection doesn't get affected at all, and even when I am two rooms away from the phone, it still continues to play with the same quality with no problems.
I can also walk around the house while being on a call, and my hands would be free to do anything I need to do.

The functionaliy is great.
All the main controls (play, pause, volume up, volume down, activating Alexa/Google Assistant, previous track, next track) can be operated from the headset itself which is very convenient if your phone isn't in immediate reach.
One of the things I loved about the headset is the Microphone. It captures my voice very well, and is much better than the mic. on my phone or my webcam.

The size is good.
It's not too bulky so it is comfortable.
The cushioning provides great comfort as well.

I also used it for gaming, and it performed amazing in that as well.
While the latency is inevitable in any Bluetooth device, it is surprisingly not bad, and doesn't feel like there is any noticable latency during a casual gaming session.
The microphone also proves useful in voice chat while gaming.",2024-10-14,5,7.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-Bluetooth-Headphones-Multipoint-Connectivity/dp/B0BS1RT9S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,,2025-01-11T21:54:13.874133,Positive,0.9363529086112976

• sound quality is decent, there is ANC (active noise cancellation) which isn't really good, you will be disappointed if you bought it for noice cancellation, it does supress a little external sound but not even remotely impressive

• It looks beautiful, mine is black, although it doesn't seem very durable, now i am confident i can take great care of it, but if you aren't careful then it might end up breaking within first few months of purchase.

• Ambient mode is extremely helpful during functions or any event where you need to be attentive, maybe someone is calling you or something else, so using Ambient mode you can hear external sound more clearly

• One of the main reason i bought it is because of the battery, and it didn't disappoint, absolute monster when it comes to battery, you can use it for 6 hours continuously and only 10%-5% battery will be consumed.

• It is also extremely comfortable and covers your ears really well, it's foldable but again handle with care, it doesn't seem very durable, modes such as signature sound makes the listening phenomenal.

• Gaming - now i didn't expect it to perform this well in terms of gaming but i was surprised, while they didn't mention anything about gaming experience, it did perform very well, games checked - (PUBG, Terraria, COD, Dead Cells, Little Nightmare).",2024-01-17,5,56.0,https://amazon.in/boAt-Rockerz-550-Headphone-Aesthetics/dp/B08R7M1JM5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2JZVEFDQST5XV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08R7M1JM5#R2JZVEFDQST5XV,2025-01-11T21:55:11.919679,Positive,0.7506380081176758

I bought it as a self birthday gift and was amazed by the sound quality. the ANC is good but I personally don't use it much. don't expect it to completely block the outside noise when you are not playing something, that too if you are in a very noisy environment else it works pretty descent.

Coming to the main part, the SPEAKERS.... I mean, THEY ARE AWESOME.
I use them for EDMs, Indian classical, instrumental, and what not and this baby always amaze me with the detailed sound. I personally tweaked it for the trebles and bass levels to squeeze the most of it and it was worth it.

But we skipped the important part, didn't we. the BATTERY, and let me tell you, it literally lasts for 50hrs. I use to charge it once a two week and use it on a daily basis of 3-4 hrs so i guess it lasts more than 50hrs?? don't know but one things sure, you wont be disappointed by the battery performance.

so this is the conclusion,
battery: 5/5
speakers: 5/5
anc: 4/5
build quality: 5/5

I bought the Mint green which looks classy.
What I love about it:
- Nice finish
- Soft ear cushions and fit well around the ears
- gives an immersive listening experience
- Easy access buttons for volume, On/Off and ANC
- Sound quality is quite good for me
- Thoughtful of the brand to give extra pins for Piano jack and Airplane input too.

Slightly less points for:
- It's a little tight and not comfortable wearing for long time, at least for me as i have small ears, so it starts pressing on the jaw bone

"Srhythm NC25 Wireless Headphones Bluetooth 5.3,Lightweight Noise Cancelling Headset Over-Ear with Low Latency,Game Mode",B083S6Q8VK,R182C2921COC6A,Good headphone but can be better,Dipankar,"I found this headphone which looks and to some extent has features of high-end headphone but at somewhat low cost. I got Rs 3000 discount on the sale price of Rs 8500 which is one of the reasons I bought it apart from some positive reviews of the product I saw before buying it.

The positive points about the headphone are:
 - Over the ear headphone which actually covers your ears and does not sit on your ear
 - Bluetooth setup and connection is easy and has good reception
 - mic is good and sound quality during calls is clear but due to bluetooth range sometimes the voice breaks once you move a bit away from your phone/computer
 - ANC seems to be working well
 - charge capacity is good
 - quite light-weight and easy control keys on the right side of the headphone to accept and reject calls/change track and change sound volume

Now there are few points which could have been better for a headphone at this price-range:
 - The most frustrating point with this headphone is that its loudness capacity is quite low for a headphone like this and maximum volume does not really seems max (I always have to keep the headphone volume to max). For other good headphones used I found the loudness (max volume) is much much higher. So if you are into heavy metals and rock you may not find this headphone very useful.
- The bass quality is not too great
- Though it is actually an over the ear headphone, but I found it is a bit uncomfortable (atleast in hot and humid weather) when both the ears are covered for long time. That maybe also because I am used to inside the ear headphone mostly.
 Overall I feel it is okay to buy this headphone if you want to mostly attend calls and hear light music.",2020-06-15,3,12.0,https://amazon.in/Srhythm-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-NC25/dp/B083S6Q8VK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R182C2921COC6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B083S6Q8VK,2025-01-11T22:08:28.249061,Positive,0.9609390497207642

This is my first HEADphone. Ive till date used wired earphones and neckbands.

The sound quality and bass have surprised me. This is a 7 day review
At 1300, I would buy it anytime. It so freaking good.

My head is a little big , but then too fits perfectly. The cushion quality is also very comfortable.
The Bluetooth connection is also good and considerably fast.
Played COD(without aux) and its truely 40ms latency. So kudos in that area too.
Love it

little problem with the aux wire. The wired connection is okay.

The comfort could have been a bit better, the cups could have been a bit deep but it's manageable.

"Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery-Black",B0BS1PRC4L,R1FROBSTZ2XO80,Are they worth the price in 2024 - Detailed review,SREEKUMAR,"So if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read. I know it's somewhat lengthy :( but if you've already bought this pair, skip to the last part, that is, bonus.

Sound quality:-
Pretty good. As you might know, Sony is Sony when it comes to sound. The audio is clear and has that calm, balanced profile that I prefer to the bass oriented profiles of BoAt and JBL. If you are a basshead, I don't think these headphones will be your go to. But if you've been using bass heavy headphones, you will feel and instant change in audio quality and the overall beauty of music once you switch to a Sony device. Keep in mind that I'm not a professional audiophile or something. I love listening to quality music and watching movies and these headphones are perfect. I use Apple music and the sound is bliss, idk about Spotify though but I think it will fare equally well. I like bass and these headphones do provide bass, just that they are not overkill and distort the entire sound looking for it. These feel more premium in the sound department. However some people might feel a lack of excitement in their sound out of the box. Worry not, I've added an EQ tweak to fix your problem at the end of this review.

Specs:-
 30mm drivers. So not as loud as the 40mm ones BoAt and JBL offer in this price range. But I've felt (personally) the audio quality to be better. Bluetooth 5.2 which is solid. Multipoint connection makes sure that this will not be outdated soon. They've been released in 2023 and will remain in contention for atleast a couple of years. Multipoint has to be turned on in headphones app and I use it to connect the headphones to my Macbook to watch movies and to my android phone, which might be on charging or in another room, to attend calls. The switching is seamless and works well. They don't have touch controls though, so it will take a couple of tries to learn to get the buttons right, especially in a dark room. They have DSEE which is basically a feature to enhance low quality/ compressed audios downloaded from internet. It has to be turned on in the app and is not needed for Spotify or Apple music as they are already best quality music and DSEE takes up additional battery charge. Battery is solid. They were 70% out of the box and after 20 hr playback still had 50% left. So I guess they'll last for atleast 50 hrs like they claim on the box. I don't like charging my devices all the time and I use them for max 5 hrs a day for which they will last close to 2 weeks which is good. No ANC though, it's not a problem for me but if it is for you, don't buy. Mic is good, I've attended calls in the midst of traffic and they were pretty fine.

Comfort:-
I've tried many midrange headphones and these are some of the best in terms of comfort too. Soft earcups that sit compact on my ear. However if they are not positioned properly, they might exert pressure. But on proper positioning, they will give 2 to 2.5 hours playback without any discomfort. After that you will have to take a break. I don't have big ears btw. They are lightweight and have an adjustable headband with cushion. So as far as on ear headphones are concerned, these are comfortable.

Build:-
Plastic but feels durable. Not creaking. The earcups are the types which forms wrinkles, they look durable but I don't know if they will pinch unless I use it for atleast 6 months. Anyway these have replacement earcups available online and in Sony service centers. I have one near my house. I don't think they are sweat resistant so don't use it for workouts. For jogging they will stay in place once positioned compactly, but for running they will slip off ear.

Drawbacks:-
Lack of aux cable. Once you are out of charge, that's that. It says they support fast charging on box, but I haven't tried that so idk. Normally takes 2 hours atleast to charge from 20 to 100. Another drawback is portability. They are not foldable and even though the plastic feels durable, I'd suggest you don't bump them much. While travelling either buy a case or carry them around in the box they come with (don't worry about looking cheap, the box doesn't have anything like specs or other bs written on it. Only thing written is Sony. It's inside the white cover that mentions specs).

Conclusion:-
They offer value for money if you ask me. The sound is premium for a budget segment and not too bass oriented. The headphone app means it will get firmware updates and has some listening modes that actually work, it is not a gimmick. They look and feel premium too. And unlike Anker or ATH, they have service centers all over so if any issue pops up, that's an added boost too. The don't have an in box warranty card but worry not, the moment you connect your device to the headphones app they are registered. Keep the Amazon invoice with you, in the box or download it in pdf form from your orders section.

Bonus:-
If the headphones lack excitement to you out of the box, the headphones app offer some preset EQ. But I will share this tweak I found from reddit. They worked for me so if you don't know how to configure the EQ on your own, try this;
Select manual on EQ in Sony headphones app.
Put 400 to 2.
Put 1k to 4.
Put 2.5k to 7.
Put 6.3k to 7.
Put 16k to 5.
Put clear bass to 2.
Try out this tweak and see if it works for you. This works on some higher end Sony models too. Enjoy your headphones!!!",2024-06-26,5,352.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-Bluetooth-Headphones-Multipoint-Connectivity/dp/B0BS1PRC4L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1FROBSTZ2XO80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS1PRC4L#R1FROBSTZ2XO80,2025-01-11T22:12:45.747012,Positive,0.6232458353042603

"Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery-Black",B0BS1PRC4L,R3PODK5XJLLASD,Amazing!,Tej Prashant Nemane,"The quality feels rich.
The sound is crisp and premium, and even though JBL or boAt alternatives might provide a little more bass in their headsets than this, the sound quality of this one is definitely much better.
Bass isn't everything; the overall sound quality matters, and the bass is sufficient.

The Bluetooth connectivity is amazing.
When I am walking in the house with the phone in one place, the connection doesn't get affected at all, and even when I am two rooms away from the phone, it still continues to play with the same quality with no problems.
I can also walk around the house while being on a call, and my hands would be free to do anything I need to do.

The functionaliy is great.
All the main controls (play, pause, volume up, volume down, activating Alexa/Google Assistant, previous track, next track) can be operated from the headset itself which is very convenient if your phone isn't in immediate reach.
One of the things I loved about the headset is the Microphone. It captures my voice very well, and is much better than the mic. on my phone or my webcam.

The size is good.
It's not too bulky so it is comfortable.
The cushioning provides great comfort as well.

I also used it for gaming, and it performed amazing in that as well.
While the latency is inevitable in any Bluetooth device, it is surprisingly not bad, and doesn't feel like there is any noticable latency during a casual gaming session.

These headphones combine impressive sound quality with convenient features that make them a joy to use daily.

Firstly, the sound signature is classic JBL: rich, powerful bass that doesn't overwhelm the clear mids and highs. Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio quality remains consistently excellent, providing an immersive experience.

The battery life on these headphones is outstanding. With up to 40 hours of playtime on a single charge, I rarely find myself reaching for the charging cable. When I do need a quick top-up, the quick charge feature is incredibly handy, providing several hours of playback with just a short charging session.

Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity ensures a stable connection with minimal dropouts, and I appreciate the dual pairing feature that allows me to connect to two devices simultaneously. Switching between my phone and laptop is seamless, which adds to the overall convenience.

The headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, thanks to the ergonomic design and plush ear cushions that provide a good seal while minimizing fatigue. The foldable design makes them easy to store and carry in the included pouch, perfect for travel or commuting. It has built in mic and the quality of the mic is also good.

NOT the best product but for the price point in this brand? I really can't complain. The build product feels cheap, like plastic or maybe is it plastic? I don't know but it feels cheap with matte finish and simple design.

The meat of the product, The sound quality is fine but the bass, I won't call it great yet won't call it decent. If I was given a scale to rate the bass of this speaker, I would give it 6.5 or 7 at best out of 10. Noise Cancelling is great here, haven't gotten issue with this part so far.

The battery is fine, since I use it on everyday basis I think, I can get at best 3 to 4 hours a day without charging for a week's use.

The comfort is assuring, I never once found discomfort using this product nor irritations, able to move around hassle-free. The cushion, however looks rugged which I personally don't like, was comfy providing protection to my hear.

Honestly, I'd give this product 3.5 or 3.75 out of 5 overall, as I am not a huge fan of it's bass, it's just on the borderline mark, and the placeholder on where you need to charge, this particular product made me feel I was solving a rubix cube to find the placeholder. I have gone through the instructions but, at times when I'm on rush or something related to it, I don't find comfort finding the ports on this product.",2023-11-13,4,8.0,https://amazon.in/JBL-Wireless-Headphones-Bluetooth-Assistant/dp/B08QTYYNDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2J77FLNWF00IY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08QTYYNDN,2025-01-11T22:13:46.929879,Negative,0.45274555683135986

Pros:
1. Impressive Sound Quality: The bass performance is exceptional, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience. Whether I’m listening to music or watching videos, the sound quality is clear and powerful.
2. Stylish Design: The Furious Red color gives these earphones a bold and attractive look. They stand out, and I appreciate the sleek design that complements my style.
3. Comfortable Fit: The in-ear design comes with multiple ear tips, allowing me to find the perfect fit. They stay securely in place, even during workouts or long listening sessions.
4. Built-in Microphone: The mic works well for phone calls and voice commands. The sound quality during calls is clear, making conversations easy and hassle-free.
5. Tangle-Free Cable: The cable is made from a durable material that resists tangling, which is a huge plus for me. It makes storage and transport much more convenient.
6. Affordable Price: Given their performance and quality, these earphones are very reasonably priced. They offer great value compared to many other brands in the market.

Cons:
1. Limited Noise Isolation: While the earphones provide decent passive noise isolation, they may not completely block out external sounds in noisy environments. Users seeking a more immersive experience might want to consider noise-canceling options.
2. Cable Durability: Although the cable is tangle-free, it might be prone to wear and tear with heavy usage. Care should be taken to avoid pulling or bending it excessively.
3. Sound Signature: The bass-heavy sound signature may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those who prefer a more balanced sound profile. It might overpower mids and highs in certain music genres.
4. No Inline Controls: While the microphone is handy for calls, there are no inline controls for volume or playback, which can be inconvenient for some users.

Overall:
The boAt Bassheads 100 in Ear Wired Earphones (Furious Red) are an excellent choice for anyone seeking quality sound and comfort at an affordable price. With impressive bass, a stylish design, and a comfortable fit, they’re perfect for daily use.

"JBL C100SI Wired In Ear Headphones with Mic, JBL Pure Bass Sound, One Button Multi-function Remote, Premium Metallic Finish, Angled Buds for Comfort fit (Black)",B01DEWVZ2C,RSVU1IA6D0YCG,BEWARE OF IT'S DURABILITY!!!!!! Though it sounds really good and all. BUT...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;,Angelina Castellino,"BUT...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Let’s know about its DURABILITY according to me when using this daily with care. So according to me this product is not durable at all in terms of its poor quality rubber material based CABLE which usually always tends to get tangled and wears out really fast when kept in a bag or a pouch and hence as time goes by it leads to affecting its performance in many ways in the long run and so my review is based on one of the major issues that i faced and so this is how it started..........
So first of all AMAZON is not at all blamed for the fault of this product as they packaged it well and delivered it on time before the expected delivery date and i am completely satisfied with AMAZON & it’s SERVICES!!!!!
And so it’s the company that did not design this product to last for more than a year or less than that!!!!!!!!

Anyway I Bought this product on Amazon in the MONTH of OCTOBER in the YEAR 2019 and everything went smooth after opening the package as I enjoyed this pair of earphones so much so that I did not realize that it's cable design, durability and built quality was really poor and hence I kept on using it and it never failed on me and always worked well but all of a sudden in the MONTH of MARCH in the YEAR 2020 which is two months from when i posted my review about this product, i had a major issue and it was that the right earphone all of a sudden stopped working out of nowhere while listening to music one day and later it was discovered by me that it would only work if I keep moving the top cable of the right earphone which is attached the 1 Button Remote With The Microphone and so it would start working and stop working as soon as I let go of the cable and this means that there was some loose connection between the  Button Remote and the cable which should not happen as it cost a lot of money and jBL is well known company and they have outstanding products with fairly good prices compared to BOSE which is better but really highly overpriced. So currently I will call jBL CUSTOMER CARE and ask them to resolve the issue by either repairing my earphones or if not repairable that replace it with a new one as its still under its WARRANTY PERIOD!!!!!
 So I will put an update as soon as I’m done solving my issue!!!!!

FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET WHICH IS BELOW RS 600/- or BELOW RS 700/- THEN!!!!! AND ONCE AGAIN ONLY THEN!!!!! GO FOR THIS PRODUCT AS IT’S A GREAT PAIR OF EARPHONES UNDER YOUR BUDGET AT A HUGE DISCOUNTED PRICE!!!!! BUT IF YOU BUDGET IS BELOW RS 1000/- AND YOU LOVE jBL SIGNATURE SOUND THEN GO FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TANGLE FREE CABLE AS THEY WILL DEFINITELY LAST LONGER AS IN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT :)

AND SO GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE ANY PAIR OF EARPHONES OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY PLEASE DO BUY THE ONES WITH THE TANGLE-FREE CABLE AS I HAVE A PAIR of HEADPHONES WITH A TANGLE-FREE CABLE AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 3 YEARS BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO IT AT ALL AND IT STILL WORKS WELL.

SO GO AND GET SOME GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES if needed AT A VERY GOOD PRICE ON Amazon.in AS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE GOOD AFTER SALE SERVICES ACCORDING TO ME!!!!!!!!!!

This is my first HEADphone. Ive till date used wired earphones and neckbands.

The sound quality and bass have surprised me. This is a 7 day review
At 1300, I would buy it anytime. It so freaking good.
The plastic build is also quite nice. Gives a very decent look.
My head is a little big , but then too fits perfectly. The cushion quality is also very comfortable.
The Bluetooth connection is also good and considerably fast.
Played COD(without aux) and its truely 40ms latency. So kudos in that area too.
Love it

Drawbacks -
little problem with the aux wire. The wired connection is okay.

"Noise Airwave Max 4 Wireless Over-Ear Headphones with 70H Playtime, ENC, 40mm Driver, Low Latency(up to 40ms), Dual Pairing, BT v5.4 (Calm Beige)",B0CY1PL36Q,R3D5NP2Z6QDZK2,**Product Review: Comprehensive Look at These Budget-Friendly Headphones**,epikgamedev,"After nearly a month of using these headphones extensively (10-12 hours daily), I can confidently say that they deliver impressive performance, especially considering the price range. Here’s a detailed breakdown of their strengths and minor drawbacks based on my experience.

### Comfort and Long Usage
One of the highlights is the comfort level; even after prolonged use, the fit remains snug without causing discomfort, which makes them ideal for long listening sessions. This aspect is especially notable given that many headphones in this range tend to fall short on comfort for extended wear.

### Sound Quality
The audio quality is balanced, with a satisfying clarity in both mids and highs. For casual listeners and music enthusiasts alike, these headphones provide a pleasant sound profile.

However, there are some nuances:
- **Volume and Sound Leakage**: The volume output is robust, though after the 50-60% mark, there’s noticeable sound leakage, which progressively increases as the volume rises. At full volume (100%), the sound is uncomfortably loud, and the bass becomes highly pronounced, creating a tactile vibration that can be felt upon touching the headphones. While this bass emphasis might appeal to bass lovers, it’s not ideal for balanced listening at maximum volume. Additionally, at this level, the leakage is substantial—effectively turning the headphones into mini speakers that can be heard across a room. This is not conducive to a private listening experience, but it is manageable when the volume is kept at 80% or below.

- **Low-Volume Performance**: On the flip side, these headphones perform admirably in quiet environments; I can listen comfortably at just 10% volume and still hear everything clearly, even in a room with background noise from a fan. For my regular usage, I find 30% volume is perfect for music, while 60% works well for videos and movies.

### Battery Life
Battery life is another area where these headphones shine. The manufacturer’s claim of 70 hours holds true. I’ve been charging them every 4-5 days despite rigorous usage, and they consistently deliver, making them reliable for extended listening sessions without frequent recharging.

### Dual Pairing Capability
A standout feature is the **dual pairing capability**, which works seamlessly. I can connect both my PC and mobile simultaneously, and the headphones automatically switch audio sources based on activity. When I press play on one device, media playback on the other device automatically pauses, ensuring a smooth, uninterrupted experience. Additionally, the headphones will automatically pause media playback if a call comes in, making them versatile and convenient for multitasking across devices.

### Controls and Connectivity
The buttons on the right side are intuitive and well-placed, making it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks, and take calls without fumbling. The included aux cable for wired mode works well for most setups, though the cable length may be a bit short for desktop connections.

### Value for Money
For their price range, these headphones are highly competitive. While other options might prioritize crowd-pleasing, bass-heavy sound profiles, these provide a more balanced output that doesn’t overshadow other frequencies. Combined with the impressive battery life, they stand out against alternatives that may compromise longevity for exaggerated bass.

### Final Verdict
For anyone looking for affordable headphones that don’t sacrifice sound quality or comfort, these are an excellent choice.

Pros:

*Build Quality: The body is made out of plastic which feels durable. The joints from where the headphones extends are made from plastic but reinforced with metal and gives a promising feel. Overall sturdy build for the price range.

*Battery Life: The battery lasts impressively long on a single charge – easily gets me through days without needing to recharge. for the fact i have recieved these headphones with around 70% charge and since then i have charged these headphones only twice that too only for around 30 mins.

*Sound Quality: The clarity and balance of sound is really good with Clear mids and highs. you can easily feel all the different instruments while listening to the music. The bass is also really good i wont say these are bass oriented headphones tho.

*Comfort: The fit is really good for my head and the headphones are Lightweight and actually comfortable for extended wear. you can easily bingewatch wearing them. Best thing is the Soft ear pads that don’t press too hard.

*Connectivity: Bluetooth connects instantly and Dual pairing works smoothly across my laptop and phone. although i have faced very few Dual pairing fails where it gets disconnected from both the devices and keeps on reconnecting untill you restart the connections.

Cons:

*Microphone: the microphone quality in these headphones are really bad and can sometimes be unusable if you are to talk slowly or when in outdoors

overall if your budget is around 2500....you can go for these headphones which were really good for music and movies. The surround sounds are just so good. but dont buy these if you need them for calls.",2024-10-29,4,4.0,https://amazon.in/Noise-Launched-Wireless-Headphones-Playtime/dp/B0CY1PL36Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R11L0LOCYKEXBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CY1PL36Q,2025-01-11T22:37:27.590965,Positive,0.5407872200012207

My main purpose was to use headphones for a long duration and no compromise in sound quality........
And this satisfies the purpose very well.....
The issue I found is with the amazon packaging......
There were no bubblewraps nothing except an outer packaging or box. I ordered 2 things and got the same issue with the packaging.
Due to this my headphones has got minor scratches and wear marks.

Otherwise this is a great product.... If you want better sound quality and can use in ear earphones go for IEMs ........
IEMs will offer a tremendous upgrage in the sound quality........

The base is really good...... I was previously using Oppo Enco M32 Neckband. And can tell that the Oppo ones sound good than this, also they are 1000rs cheap.

Pros:
1. Good Connectivity and connect fast.
2. It fits good in the ear but I suggest don’t use for lengthy conversations even for music listening.
3. Antique a good collection.
4. The app is not that much will be used, almost no use.
5. Touch controls are good
6. Noise cancellation is good I didn’t see anyone complaining due to the noises.

Cons:
1. Confusion about the status of charging, especially when full charge is completed.
Powering on/off is confusion, i don't think it is even happening; only when you put buds in the case then only it ON and OFF the buds.

2. 2-3 hrs continue running, 1st right will get down and then after sometime left down.
standy maybe 6-7 hrs.

Most definitely go for it (⁠｡⁠♡⁠‿⁠♡⁠｡⁠),Aman Anand,"Before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-
1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence I was concerned.
2. Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.
3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .
4.Sturdiness and Build quality.
5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.
6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.

Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.

1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.
2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.
3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones. Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .
4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).
5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.
6. With Bluetooth , its justt Awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. Though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠Ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ I Like It (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode. Can keep using it even if the battery is dead. I Like this feature so much. For a student like me , its a charmer. No unnecessary breaks . And With the full sound ☠️ You won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ Its that awesome.  Sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. I mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. It is crazyyyy . You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.

It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones. But I have used Boat Rockerz which my friend has , And I can say without a doubt , Giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.The comfort , the looks , the loudness , the RGB (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). I even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.
I'm so glad I bought this as my first headphones. I was very skeptical but now that I'm using it 😍 , Its just a wonderful experience.

Most negative comments I believe are one in hundred Instances or anomaly or exceptions. Most people DON'T review a product till it's defective. Only very few people review when the product it perfect.
This is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.
Don't worry bout anything , just go for it. Luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. Its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. Anyway. Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.",2023-06-08,5,507.0,https://amazon.in/Zebronics-Bluetooth-Headphone-Multifunction-Black/dp/B088FM4QG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3F94R6AM0IOKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_img?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B088FM4QG4,2025-01-11T22:53:14.628205,Negative,0.5687764883041382

The product is very good, I didn't yet test the microphone because its just been 2 days, I can hear everything very good. Charger and AUX wire is also given at very proper length. The length adjustment of the headphones is also okay. Very looong battery. Soft ear cushions. It take very long to off the headphones but its okay.
I gave it 4 stars only because, sometimes while listening to music, I hear some kind of noise, not from my surroundings but from the headphones.

And I can say at the prize point that this headphones available is really really good.
Headphones come with the 40 mm drivers which actually helps to create a mesmerizing sound but the problem is sometimes the bass is very over powering so sometimes you are not able to hear the medis & vocals clearly. They are loud and battery backup in this headphone is really good.
The day this headphone arrived it was on 100% charging and i have used the headphone for 6 days and after that it discharged.

Fit of the headphones are good sturdy.

I have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.

Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.

PROS:
- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted
- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape
- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer
- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.

CONS:
- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said
- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while
- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.
- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it. Only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. This means I always have to carry an additional wire in my backpack

Overall decent pair. In my previous (edited now) review, I mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. After several days I realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. So, I have edited my review and updated the rating

The reviews are very polarising (either good or bad) and to my surprise neither were truly wrong. So i was skeptical but i found it on sale for 999 so i just bought it.. I will do a pros and cons first and a super detailed review after it (the review will be given keeping the price range of 1500-2000 in mind)
Pros:
- Build Quality
- Sound Quality (after EQ) [Amazing Bass, crystal clear and lively vocals with ear-fatigue free & nice treble tones]
- Battery Life
- Dual Connectivity and stable connection
- No noticeable latency in videos
- Comfort
- Sick RGB

Cons:
- Mic Quality
-Sound Quality (without EQ) [Amazing Bass, Bad vocals, Bad treble tones]
-Low battery indications every 60 secs after 20% (didn't say 1 min as people might take it as an exaggeration)
- You cant change or keep 1 colour on rgb, it changes on its own
- Few Service Centres
- Sometimes the headphones goes into a weird state where you have to keep the power button pressed for 10-30 seconds for it to work again

Minor cons (which are completely fine for the price but are worth mentioning)
-the rgb also turns on each time you power on the headphone so turning it off for more battery gets a bit annoying
-The earcups dont fold (if you want to keep them on your neck then you will have to extend them , after that they wont restrict your head movement)
-Each time you start/turn off the headphones or it connects/disconnects there is a voice announcement which i found to be quite annoying

DETAILED REVIEW

1) Build Quality: The headband is made of made up of metal and looks very sturdy. The plastic used on the earcups is also of a good quality and i don't think it will break easily. The wire that is visible is thick and i aint worried about it. The earcups dont fold (which i knew) but it could have been a good addition.  The cushioning on the headband is minimal but soft so you wont have a problem there. The ear cushions are very soft. Dimensions of entire ear cushion 10cm x 8cm . Dimensions of the opening for our ears 5.6cm x 4cm.The buttons wobble a little bit in their place but are clicky & tactile. The box it comes in, is very Sturdy and can be used to keep the headphone.

2) Looks: The headphone has a sick matte black colour which i love, the side profile looks amazing, it does look a bit bulky and weird when you look at it from the front though.

3) Comfort:  I thought the hole should be as big as my ear to be comfortable which was not the case, my ear is like 6 cm and it still fits inside (with unnoticeable bending as the hole does get a bit bigger inside due to the pressure of our earlobes against it). The headphone does not feel heavy at all. The clamping force is just enough to keep the headphone from slipping, it isn't much which increases the comfort. The earcup wobbles a bit for a comfortable angle on your head. The clicks to increase or decrease the size are tight so the size wont change when you shake your head. I didn't have any discomfort wearing it for 4-5 hours straight. Although, the ears do sweat after 2-3 hours in normal temperature so you have to take a break of 2 mins (it doesnt feel warm but the sweat can speed up the wear and tear of the ear cushions. the way i do it is to just let out the air inside the headphones every once in like 30 mins for 15 secs which is much more efficient)

Note: If its your first time wearing an over ear headphone then it might take a couple of days to get used to the weight and clamping force. Also, like all over ear headphones, they will be tight out of the box but they will loosen up after several hours of use (you can just put it on a pillow in between the earcushions instead if your head overnight)

4) Battery Life: I think it goes upto 20-22 hours on higher volumes (can be used only till 20% is left, after that unusable due to voice alerts)

5) Charging Time: Takes about 1hr 45 mins to go from 20% to 100%

6) Connectivity: I tried going into another room and it worked just fine so don't worry about the range. This headphone has dual connectivity which isn't mentioned anywhere, you can connect with 2 devices and if you play something with 1 device, the other pauses and vice versa

7) Latency: There is no noticeable latency in most videos or movies (there is a very slight delay which you can notice if you try noticing it hard but you wont do that while watching anything so its safe to say there is no noticeable latency, the latency can also be noticed if the person talks really fast)

8) Gaming: When you do gaming via bluetooth you will notice the latency like pretty much every wireless product without a gaming mode of 80ms latency. You can make out where the sound is coming from pretty easily. You can use the aux to get 0 latency.

9) Mic: The mic is straight up bad, lacks both clarity and loudness (Do note that the mic won't work with the aux cable)

10) Sound Isolation: You can't really hear anything of outside if something is playing in your headphones. If the volume is loud the people around you can hear it which is a con, other headphones do a better job here

11) Sound Quality (without EQ): The bass is very powerful, perfect for bass lovers but the mids and highs aren't even good

12) Sound Quality (with basic EQ):The Sound is loud enough at 100% for pretty much anyone who does not have significant hearing loss. The bass can be made less powerful or even more powerful if you want to blast your skull with the bass. The mids are produced very nicely. The highs are on point (neither sharp nor dull, its sparky enough without causing ear fatigue). The clarity is also very nice, the sounds seems crystal clear and crispy The distortion is very less.
(Note: My Basic EQ is just take the little dots in the right half and increase all of them to some extent, keep the leftmost dot where it was and try to make a straight line between the leftmost and middle dots with the other dots left in the left half). One thing to note is that, you will find that the headphone skipped a word, its random and not that often but its worth mentioning

13) Sound quality via aux: The same things apply here but the max volume is 90% of what it was via bluetooth and the clarity gets a boost if you play FLAC format music

1 Year Edit for Durability: Everything still stands true, the earcup vinyl (i think that is the material) started
coming off suddenly after 10 months i think and now its gone but it doesnt make a difference to sound or comfort. It randomly stopped working, i think the power button disconnected so i sent them via courier to the service centre (in warranty) and they sent it back in a week i think. I dropped them twice from 3 feet and it stayed fine, but someone sat on my headphones and one side got de-attached from the headband held on just by wire, it then dropped twice after that and that one side stopped working. I tried contacting service centres about how much the repair will cost so that i dont end up spending 400 or something to get this headphone repaired when i bought it for 999 but they didnt respond so i can spend either 100 to get this to the service centre by courier (most companies have a pick up service like soundcore) or go 20km away to get it repaired myself (which is hard during covid).

"ZEBRONICS Duke Wireless Headphone with Up to 60h Backup, Supports Bluetooth, Dual Pairing, Gaming Mode, Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC), LED Lights, Deep Bass, Voice Assistant Support (Black)",B088FM4QG4,R14UZV0X8M46AL,A must buy for normal usage and long battery backup,Divyansh Sharma,"I'm reviewing it after using for 2 days
Connectivity- it's pretty simple to connect and the Bluetooth 5.3 makes it far better and it's connection range is also pretty good
Quality - the quality of the overall headphones and packaging was good
It's foam and steady cushion top makes it better to lean on and work for a long time
Durability is also pretty good I'd say but I am not very sure as I've not used it for a long time
Call quality - it was pretty good and the other person also reported as a normal voice they were hearing
Features the main highlight

ANC - ITS not very good but I also don't have any experience about how anc should feel but according to my experience it isn't very good nor bad it just gets the work done
The music mode is pretty good I listened to about 15-17 songs and they were all in the best figure I loved this audio part
The gaming mode gives a delay of 0.3 seconds whilst the music gives about 1 sec so now you guys decide
The audio quality is fire 🔥
Also if you use the aux cable that is the best thing you can do because it provides with an astonishing bass and an unbelievable sound quality and I was actually amazed by how it turned out
Lastly the battery is as they promised I've been using it for about 4 hours now after giving it a full charge and it's still 100% so it's pretty amazing
Problems -------
1.The earcuffs are a little small so they could pose some problems
2. It is actually a little heavy and causes headaches after use for a long time
3. Nothing man it's just perfect

So my final rating is 4.5*/5*
It's upto you but it's best for daily usage and study purposes
And I'm rating it on the basis of the price I bought that was 1299/- and it's pretty durable and easy to use in this range i appreciate this on

However, in next 10-15 mins I realized that it's not working well. Lot of noise, bluetooth kept disconnecting and very next moment, I remove my headphone and 1st ear cover  is out. It's not broken but doesn't remain Intact. I call Amazon and they say that now for electronics Items, I should contact brand and when I speak to JBL(Harman), they are keep repeating same thing  - we will pick it up as warranty claim and check , if there is internal fault, we will replace it. We don't provide refunds. While taking pics, even the 2nd ear cover is out without even changing location. It's clear case of faulty product.  Then my question is - Internal fault checking, fine? but who takes care of weird design  hardware where these ear covers are coming out without any usage? Does Brand doesn't own this problem that it should be designed in a way that ear covers remain intact atleast for a month or 6 months? It just came out within 20 mins of usage for 1 side and other side without any issues or man handling. Harman/JBL is very adamant that they are not going to provide refund or replacement for design fault, they will chk only for internal fault and replace it if they find it. All this will take 5-10 Days. So, now I have wasted my money. and stuck with broken headset. Called back Amazon customer care and after few rounds, they connected me to technical customer care who were able to ask right questions and identified that this is a defective product. Hopefully they will do a replacement. But wanted to warn all buyers about this scam where Brand will not take any responsibility if you get a defective fault. They will only test for internal issues.

The sound quality is exceptional, with clear and crisp highs, and deep bass. The earbuds fit snugly in my ears, and the ergonomic design makes them comfortable to wear for extended periods.

The battery life is impressive, lasting around 56 hours on a single charge. The charging case is compact and convenient, making it easy to top up my earbuds on-the-go.

One feature that really stands out is the noise-cancellation technology. It effectively blocks out background noise, allowing me to fully immerse myself in music or podcasts.

Overall, I'd highly recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a reliable, high-quality, and affordable listening experience.""Bluetooth conectivity is excellly, catches the phone very easily

> Does not have dual connect - just a single connect
> Even single connect is very buggy and just so to ""wake"" the earphones if you accidentally tap x3 times, you are doomed - because that is the RESET option and thus it immediately disconnects leaving you to re-pair the device and use
> Mic quality is extremely poor - got feedback that it seems that I am speaking from another corner of the room, even though its snugly placed on my ears. and yes it does not have dual or quad mic and definitely NOT MEMS
> I dont know how, but just once I managed to switch to spatial audio - and there is no refernce to it in the manual
> No other options in touch like eq or bassmode or anything
> Not worth the price ( yoga beat is 100x better and half priced )
> Could not return, as date range has passed so have to keep it
> Did not test, but possibly battery life is good as I charged it 3-4 times only

I own a S1 and also Clarity 2 which performs much much better than this

Eventually had to buy truke Yoga Beat, which is surprisingly half the price and is an excellent OWS ( cannot post review here as bought from somewhere)

In short - keep away from this and dont buy

I will also mention that truke does make quality and affordable stuff and thus have bought only  its stuff, but this is Heavily Disappointing both in product, and then looking at the price that you pay

About the tech - yes in-ear buds do cause more wax development and some hearing loss in time succession, for which I switched to OWS, as I have to work with them for hours at strech sometimes",2024-08-05,1,52.0,https://amazon.in/truke-360SpatialTM-Experience-Beryllium-Crystal-Clear/dp/B0D5R4L2XD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3SGQLPFAFEVWV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5R4L2XD,2025-01-11T22:55:32.685247,Negative,0.952504575252533

Visualize it as listening to music with transparency mode always on.

Playing music/podcasts on these feels like you're still in the real world and there's an added soundtrack from your surroundings. If you raise the volume enough, it still pretty much has the capability to isolate you from the outside noise but it might hurt your ears a bit too.

Usually I keep my volume at around 30% at home and 60-70% outdoors and it works great for me.

They do lack bass but it varies. In quiet, night time environments they do deliv 70% of the bass but in daytime and indoors, they deliver 40%. Outdoors that bass comes down to 10%.

The mic quality is okay-ish. Everytime I've talked to people in a semi-noisy environment, people have asked me to take my earphones off so that's not a good sign.

Besides that, the touch controls are very responsive, which is also why I'm giving these 4 stars instead of 5. The touch sensitive are is so large and responsive that even the slightest adjustment to the buds can cancel a call or pause playback. It's very annoying when it happens and for me, it sure happens atleast once a day.

Battery life is insane, these buds are comfortable and you can wear them and forget charging them. Sometimes Infact, I even forget that I'm wearing them which only testifies their comfortable fit. But also they're still a little loose on my ears.

I'm 5""8' and it feels like my ears should have been a little larger for them to fit me best.

The comfort level is outstanding—even after hours of wearing them, there’s no discomfort or pressure on my ears. The ear cushions are soft, and the fit feels just right without being too tight.

The sound quality is phenomenal. The clarity is crisp, and the bass is deep but not overwhelming. Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or watching movies, everything sounds immersive and well-balanced. Noise isolation is also excellent, allowing me to focus without distractions.

The sound quality is absolutely incredible – rich, deep, and crystal clear. The mic performs great, making calls smooth, and the sound isolation helps me stay focused on my studies. As a student, it's a perfect choice, especially when compared to brands like Noise or BoAt in the same price range. The premium feel of these headphones really stands out.

What really sets the Blash Max apart is the design. The 180-degree rotation ensures they stay safe from damage when not in use, unlike other headsets that can break or tilt. The soft cushions and matte finish make long online classes and study sessions comfortable. Plus, they're ideal for outdoor activities, traveling, and gym workouts – they won’t fall off like buds, which is a huge bonus. Covering the full ear, they provide a much better experience than typical on-ear headphones.

The build quality is fantastic, and the customer support team is quick and responsive if you ever need assistance. The only slight drawback is the charging time, but once charged, the call quality is premium and clear, and the music is immersive. What really impressed me is the touch controls – something you rarely find in other brands at this price. If you're looking for a durable, stylish, and functional headset, the Hammer Blash Max is the way to go!",2024-11-27,4,2.0,https://amazon.in/HAMMER-Bash-Max-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B0CBFZYZM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1ASCQM7HWPVTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBFZYZM6,2025-01-11T22:56:25.723336,Positive,0.9848987460136414

"Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery-Beige",B0BZPK3XFQ,R1FROBSTZ2XO80,Are they worth the price in 2024 - Detailed review,SREEKUMAR,"So if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read. I know it's somewhat lengthy :( but if you've already bought this pair, skip to the last part, that is, bonus.

Sound quality:-
Pretty good. As you might know, Sony is Sony when it comes to sound. The audio is clear and has that calm, balanced profile that I prefer to the bass oriented profiles of BoAt and JBL. If you are a basshead, I don't think these headphones will be your go to. But if you've been using bass heavy headphones, you will feel and instant change in audio quality and the overall beauty of music once you switch to a Sony device. Keep in mind that I'm not a professional audiophile or something. I love listening to quality music and watching movies and these headphones are perfect. I use Apple music and the sound is bliss, idk about Spotify though but I think it will fare equally well. I like bass and these headphones do provide bass, just that they are not overkill and distort the entire sound looking for it. These feel more premium in the sound department. However some people might feel a lack of excitement in their sound out of the box. Worry not, I've added an EQ tweak to fix your problem at the end of this review.

Specs:-
 30mm drivers. So not as loud as the 40mm ones BoAt and JBL offer in this price range. But I've felt (personally) the audio quality to be better. Bluetooth 5.2 which is solid. Multipoint connection makes sure that this will not be outdated soon. They've been released in 2023 and will remain in contention for atleast a couple of years. Multipoint has to be turned on in headphones app and I use it to connect the headphones to my Macbook to watch movies and to my android phone, which might be on charging or in another room, to attend calls. The switching is seamless and works well. They don't have touch controls though, so it will take a couple of tries to learn to get the buttons right, especially in a dark room. They have DSEE which is basically a feature to enhance low quality/ compressed audios downloaded from internet. It has to be turned on in the app and is not needed for Spotify or Apple music as they are already best quality music and DSEE takes up additional battery charge. Battery is solid. They were 70% out of the box and after 20 hr playback still had 50% left. So I guess they'll last for atleast 50 hrs like they claim on the box. I don't like charging my devices all the time and I use them for max 5 hrs a day for which they will last close to 2 weeks which is good. No ANC though, it's not a problem for me but if it is for you, don't buy. Mic is good, I've attended calls in the midst of traffic and they were pretty fine.

Comfort:-
I've tried many midrange headphones and these are some of the best in terms of comfort too. Soft earcups that sit compact on my ear. However if they are not positioned properly, they might exert pressure. But on proper positioning, they will give 2 to 2.5 hours playback without any discomfort. After that you will have to take a break. I don't have big ears btw. They are lightweight and have an adjustable headband with cushion. So as far as on ear headphones are concerned, these are comfortable.

Build:-
Plastic but feels durable. Not creaking. The earcups are the types which forms wrinkles, they look durable but I don't know if they will pinch unless I use it for atleast 6 months. Anyway these have replacement earcups available online and in Sony service centers. I have one near my house. I don't think they are sweat resistant so don't use it for workouts. For jogging they will stay in place once positioned compactly, but for running they will slip off ear.

Drawbacks:-
Lack of aux cable. Once you are out of charge, that's that. It says they support fast charging on box, but I haven't tried that so idk. Normally takes 2 hours atleast to charge from 20 to 100. Another drawback is portability. They are not foldable and even though the plastic feels durable, I'd suggest you don't bump them much. While travelling either buy a case or carry them around in the box they come with (don't worry about looking cheap, the box doesn't have anything like specs or other bs written on it. Only thing written is Sony. It's inside the white cover that mentions specs).

Conclusion:-
They offer value for money if you ask me. The sound is premium for a budget segment and not too bass oriented. The headphone app means it will get firmware updates and has some listening modes that actually work, it is not a gimmick. They look and feel premium too. And unlike Anker or ATH, they have service centers all over so if any issue pops up, that's an added boost too. The don't have an in box warranty card but worry not, the moment you connect your device to the headphones app they are registered. Keep the Amazon invoice with you, in the box or download it in pdf form from your orders section.

Bonus:-
If the headphones lack excitement to you out of the box, the headphones app offer some preset EQ. But I will share this tweak I found from reddit. They worked for me so if you don't know how to configure the EQ on your own, try this;
Select manual on EQ in Sony headphones app.
Put 400 to 2.
Put 1k to 4.
Put 2.5k to 7.
Put 6.3k to 7.
Put 16k to 5.
Put clear bass to 2.
Try out this tweak and see if it works for you. This works on some higher end Sony models too.

"Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery-Beige",B0BZPK3XFQ,R3PODK5XJLLASD,Amazing!,Tej Prashant Nemane,"The quality feels rich.
The sound is crisp and premium, and even though JBL or boAt alternatives might provide a little more bass in their headsets than this, the sound quality of this one is definitely much better.
Bass isn't everything; the overall sound quality matters, and the bass is sufficient.

The Bluetooth connectivity is amazing.
When I am walking in the house with the phone in one place, the connection doesn't get affected at all, and even when I am two rooms away from the phone, it still continues to play with the same quality with no problems.
I can also walk around the house while being on a call, and my hands would be free to do anything I need to do.

The functionaliy is great.
All the main controls (play, pause, volume up, volume down, activating Alexa/Google Assistant, previous track, next track) can be operated from the headset itself which is very convenient if your phone isn't in immediate reach.
One of the things I loved about the headset is the Microphone. It captures my voice very well, and is much better than the mic. on my phone or my webcam.

The size is good.
It's not too bulky so it is comfortable.
The cushioning provides great comfort as well.

I also used it for gaming, and it performed amazing in that as well.
While the latency is inevitable in any Bluetooth device, it is surprisingly not bad, and doesn't feel like there is any noticable latency during a casual gaming session.
The microphone also proves useful in voice chat while gaming.",2024-10-14,5,7.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-WH-CH520-Headphones-Multipoint-Connectivity/dp/B0BZPK3XFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3PODK5XJLLASD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BZPK3XFQ,2025-01-11T22:59:31.336588,Positive,0.9363529086112976

But if you're looking for something good below 2k -- something for a relaxed usage, then yeah, this is a good choice.P.S. - Don't forget to register your warranty online soon after you get your product.

First of all, I love Japanese products and was initially leaning towards the Sony WH-CH720N. But then i read reviews for this and compared it over rtings.com and finally ended up getting these.

I was not expecting much from the noise cancellation or the bass I only needed a comfortable headphones for my work day to focus.

Oh boy was I surprised. The ANC is perfect for me. It wont drown out everything and sharp bursts of noise will come through, but anyway so complete silence is not what I need. At 50% volume (at which these sound amazing btw), it downs out the background droning noises to like 1% and I cant even tell my coworkers are speaking even if they are just 6 feet away from me (I can still here some mumbles but I wont be able to understand the words so I don't get distracted anymore).

Coming to the sound, these are my first headphones so I can only compare it to my speakers. And I am comparing apples to oranges here but in comparison to that, these are not that great, but then again those cost like 4x as much and have much more hardware so this is a stupid comparison on my end anyway.

So for these I only wanted two things - clarity and bass. These speakers have excellent quality when it comes to clarity and with the eq set to bass mode well these speakers do deliver some bass but it wont blow your mind away. But then I remember how cheap these are and I'd say they are 5/5 value for money.

And these fold up too unlike the Sony ones so storage is much easier.

I could not find any cons yet after my 1 wee use. Might edit this review if I find any.
I would just recommend you wipe down the ear pads (which are extremely comfortable btw) once a week or so, otherwise they might get damaged coz again these are pretty cheap and they would have to do cost cutting somewhere.",2024-11-22,5,8.0,https://amazon.in/JBL-Wireless-Headphones-Speedcharge-Customize/dp/B09CYX92NB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1JOEXSRQ438KZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_img?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CYX92NB,2025-01-11T23:02:38.643699,Positive,0.7792831063270569

It looks pretty good with impressive fit and finish. The buttons feel well built yet the headphone is quite light. It did not hurt my ears even after long hours of continuous use.

Sound Quality: I am an audio visual production professional and I felt it sounds quite balanced (for a JBL) in the Eq off setting. Pump up the volume and it can get pretty loud. The 'super bass' eq mode really pumps up the bass. The bass response is deep with precise attacks and releases, does not sound boomy at all. I like how these headphones sound. The calling quality too is surprisingly good. It cuts most ambient noises coming into the microphone while on a phone call.

ANC: Does the job Okay but there are much better ANC headphones available in the market. Compared to the Bose Quiet series, the apple airpods pro or even the Sony headphones with ANC these felt inferior. In my recent travel in an airplane, these headphones started crackling; especially while the airplane was taking off. The filtration of the aircraft engine sound kept varying throughout my three hours of flying.

Ergonomics: It takes a little while to get used to the position of the buttons. I felt that the ANC on-off toggle button should have been placed on the other earpiece of the headphone and not along with the power button or the volume control/play-pause buttons. Again, takes a while to get used to this button position. The charging port is on the top side of the right earpiece. Thus, you cannot use the headphones while charging them. The wired connection option is definitely a handy option if you want to use them connected to a computer on a table. The wire is a TRRS jack and kept playing in mono when connected to a TRS only socket.

Battery Backup: Very good battery backup so even with a continuous use with ANC for approx 6 hours and with about 60% volume on music and multiple phone calls, it just consumed 40% charge.

Overall verdict: It's a good buy only if you have budget constraints and you're offered hefty discounts. If not then there are far better ANC headphones available in the market.",2024-07-10,4,20.0,https://amazon.in/JBL-Wireless-Headphones-Speedcharge-Customize/dp/B09CYX92NB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1P60PB43EN43Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CYX92NB,2025-01-11T23:02:38.643699,Positive,0.9486411809921265

From the moment I unboxed them, I could tell these headphones were designed with quality and comfort in mind.

The noise-canceling feature is truly remarkable, creating a serene listening environment even in noisy surroundings. Whether I’m on a busy street or working in a bustling office, the outside world fades away, leaving me to enjoy my music, podcasts, or calls without any distractions.

The sound quality is, as expected from JBL, outstanding. The bass is punchy without being overwhelming, mids are clear, and the highs are crisp. Every genre of music sounds vibrant and full of life through these headphones. They also perform excellently during calls, with the microphone delivering clear, distortion-free audio.

Comfort is another area where the JBL Tune 770NC shines. The plush ear cushions and adjustable headband ensure a snug fit that I can wear for hours without any discomfort. The lightweight design also makes them ideal for long listening sessions.

The battery life is fantastic, lasting me through several days of use without needing a recharge. The quick charge feature is a lifesaver, giving me hours of playback with just a short charging session.

Pairing the headphones with my devices was effortless, thanks to the reliable Bluetooth connection that remains strong and stable. The controls are intuitive and easy to use, allowing me to adjust volume, skip tracks, or answer calls with ease.

Overall, the JBL Tune 770NC wireless headphones have become an essential part of my daily routine. They deliver an exceptional audio experience, superior noise-canceling capabilities, and unmatched comfort. Whether you’re a music lover, frequent traveler, or someone who simply appreciates quality audio, these headphones are a must-have.

sound quality is very good until it goes above 85% in a moving vehicle or while travelling especially when in bus , now I don't know if it's just with me or a general case but the problem arises with noise cancellation on where the headphones make a static cracking sound whenever the vehicle is moving and there are some tough spots on the road that makes the vehicle vibrate or shake alot by which it's clearly audible . Moving onto the features they are pretty amazing for a budget headphones for 6000 rupees but yet if there is some driver issues i am not able to completely enjoy the music i love to hear , moving on to the feature section one thing I like to add is the vibrating feature while the headphones are connected to your phone , i don't want my phone to vibrate with every message or call and no , i don't wanna put it completely to dnd to stop those vibrations , i tried to find a solution to this problem and also this problem could be solely to me but it got me irritated and took some time before I was used to it , anyways moving on ahead there were times while travelling when I had my headphones on and some deep bass music would be come out sounding as distorted or cracked and that made me disappointed once again . I am writing the review after completing 6 months with these headphones and it's not been that good , and recently 3 days back that was 11th December 2024 i came back from college got freshened up and connected my headphones and what I faced was i could hear from the right side only and the left side was pretty gone , i did not understand what to do at that time so I put it on charge thinking it might be low so let's see later and yet it was same , then I asked my roommate about the same he's also been using JBL headphones from past 5-6 years and I can say that the headphones have seen a lot , jokes apart he told me to tap hardly or just hit the left side of headphones once or twice to make it work ( typical Indian household advises  but to my surprise it started working , i thought it would be some glitch with the driver connections or as such but I cannot see what's inside so the maximum i could expect was not facing it again but yet I faced it 4-5 times more after that like literally the next day and the day after that and all of the time i flicked my fingers on the left ear side shell and it started working . Now coming to the build quality, i don't have much issues from it but within the 5 month the leather covering for the left side came out from the centre that covers the inside foam and yet again it made me disappointed in jbl .

anyways for my experience I don't know what else to do but I wanted to show what I faced and yea , I'll simply adapt to it and being a student this investment is making me question alot even being a hardcore music listener it feels like a mistake of buying these headphones but as Indian household says if its done it's done so yea
it might be different for you but for me it was this :)",2024-12-14,4,1.0,https://amazon.in/JBL-Wireless-Headphones-Speedcharge-Customize/dp/B09CYX92NB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3P88N4D089POP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CYX92NB,2025-01-11T23:02:38.643699,Neutral,0.43196600675582886

Build quality- It's good for the price very good build but can break if fall or someone sits on it though build quality is great  I am using it very civil manner 😜 so mine one is absolutely fine.2. Noise cancellation- It's just a gimmick do not purchase for noise cancellation they do normal passive noise cancelation but this shouldn't be your purchasing decision for this headphone.3. Bluetooth connectivity- It works absolutely perfect for Mobile, Tab, and smart TV- But with my PC it gets little connectivity issues but that's only for 1 out of 10 times but its Okay as I used it with Aux now Because my usage is high4. Battery- It was by buying decision for this headphone I purchase it for my online classes as I need great battery life and this headphone done this job absolutely perfect I got 17-18 hours of battery on the usage at sound 70% and its great believe me big battery life is must for any Bluetooth device and it's been 10 months now it's the battery is degraded as I was heavy user now it gives around 13-15 hour. so I recommend to use it with AUX if you are going to use it for a very long period it will save your battery5. Sound quality- I purchase it for battery life and I thought sound quality will be okay and it doesn't matter to me as I will be using it for classes but I was wrong the sound quality is soo good u will find this level of sound quality in the expensive headphone for the sound quality it's 10/10.6. Now some prons that pissed me of- It got an issue only with PC while connecting I have to connect and disconnect more than 3 times. but there can be Issues with my PC also IDK because this problem only happen with PC only work fine on another device- After connecting it with AUX headphone buttons and the mic doesn't work it only works on Bluetooth mode and it totally ruins the experience with AUX u can only use it for listening with AUX, not for Video calls, normal calls, and online multiplayer game Like pubg as mic doesn't work so U have to connect it Bluetooth to unlock all these features- U can't use it in summers if u have no AC in your room U will end up with lots of sweat if You use It so consider this also because If you're going to use it in a room without AC and u are living in a city like Delhi then don't purchase it.",2021-12-07,4,54.0,https://amazon.in/boAt-Rockerz-550-Headphone-Aesthetics/dp/B08R7FBBGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3VXSMZ7Z5YFX5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08R7FBBGR,2025-01-11T23:03:45.360670,Positive,0.6395928263664246

The sponge covering torn of completely after 1 year of usage and one side of the headphone broke while taking them  off my head, Really like the audio quality. One more thing I like to include is the charging port, it's built very loosely, you have to bend the whole cable and keep it tight near the port to charge.Pros: Audio quality is just awesome, u can use these headphones while listening to music ans gaming(with aux cable) too.It's is really comfortable near the ears and ear doesn't hurts after 5-6hrs of continuous usage. Battery life is also good I used to charge once in 4-6days and mostly used bluetooth.I did paired(Bluetooth only) it with my laptop and mobile at same time but headphones only process one device sound at a time so I had to mute other time to time to shift onto devices. So u have to manage this thing.It pairs with device easily without any issue or without taking much time. The aux cable is good too not too tight or too loose just perfect.Head adjustment mechanism is kinda funny because the headphones moves side to side faster when u take headphones out of adjustment idk why, could be less friction.While gaming with aux cable on u can get 0 latency(no sound delay) and can differentiate between lefts and rights and it's really helpful.I don't know the weight of headphones but they feels light on head so u can play games or watch movies without headacheCons: Build quality, full plastic body with only metal strip on head adjustment band and the plastic quality is ok ok...(cuz it broke ;-;).Charging port is loosely fitted so you have to sacrifice your cable life spanCushion are comfy but the skin or we say covering starts to fall off after some time and the headphones looks like dog water.High latency in Bluetooth mode making it use aux cable while gaming only and if u dont have aux cable port in your device so just quit these headphones and look for something else.Looks too big on head so won't recommend for gym, walk usage.You came across whole review so here's ur cookie 🍪!",2024-10-05,3,13.0,https://amazon.in/boAt-Rockerz-550-Headphone-Aesthetics/dp/B08R7FBBGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1NDWHXCEYX5LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08R7FBBGR#R1NDWHXCEYX5LG,2025-01-11T23:03:45.360670,Positive,0.7528210282325745

 Pros -  1. Lookwise good
2. Comfort level is top notch .. it doesn't fell like something is stuck inside your ear .. doesn't fall off even when you are talking or eating or walking ... Haven't tried while running though
3. Sound quality is way better ... Am a huge audiobook person ... Like 12hrs of audiobooks ...
Cons - 1. I didn't like the way it gets connected to each n every device within the radius if opened ... There should atleast have a small button that should control the connectivity...

Coming to the main part, the SPEAKERS.... I mean, THEY ARE AWESOME.I use them for EDMs, Indian classical, instrumental, and what not and this baby always amaze me with the detailed sound. I personally tweaked it for the trebles and bass levels to squeeze the most of it and it was worth it.

But we skipped the important part, didn't we. the BATTERY, and let me tell you, it literally lasts for 50hrs. I use to charge it once a two week and use it on a daily basis of 3-4 hrs so i guess it lasts more than 50hrs?? don't know but one things sure, you wont be disappointed by the battery performance.

so this is the conclusion,
battery: 5/5
speakers: 5/5
anc: 4/5
build quality: 5/5

"Srhythm NC25 Wireless Headphones Bluetooth 5.3,Lightweight Noise Cancelling Headset Over-Ear with Low Latency,Game Mode",B07F62W3TQ,R1KBHVZO5FTT3X,Comfortable and good overall,Akshayamstories,"I was super tempted by the appearance and look of these headphones that led me to research more and go through the reviews.
I bought the Mint green which looks classy.
What I love about it:
- Nice finish
- Soft ear cushions and fit well around the ears
- gives an immersive listening experience
- Easy access buttons for volume, On/Off and ANC
- Sound quality is quite good for me
- Thoughtful of the brand to give extra pins for Piano jack and Airplane input too.

Slightly less points for:
- It's a little tight and not comfortable wearing for long time, at least for me as i have small ears, so it starts pressing on the jaw bone

Note: If the Mic doesn't work for call apps on a computer, go to Sound settings and make sure you have Srhythm selected under Output devices.

"Srhythm NC25 Wireless Headphones Bluetooth 5.3,Lightweight Noise Cancelling Headset Over-Ear with Low Latency,Game Mode",B07F62W3TQ,R182C2921COC6A,Good headphone but can be better,Dipankar,"I found this headphone which looks and to some extent has features of high-end headphone but at somewhat low cost. I got Rs 3000 discount on the sale price of Rs 8500 which is one of the reasons I bought it apart from some positive reviews of the product I saw before buying it.

The positive points about the headphone are:
 - Over the ear headphone which actually covers your ears and does not sit on your ear
 - Bluetooth setup and connection is easy and has good reception
 - mic is good and sound quality during calls is clear but due to bluetooth range sometimes the voice breaks once you move a bit away from your phone/computer
 - ANC seems to be working well
 - charge capacity is good
 - quite light-weight and easy control keys on the right side of the headphone to accept and reject calls/change track and change sound volume

Now there are few points which could have been better for a headphone at this price-range:
 - The most frustrating point with this headphone is that its loudness capacity is quite low for a headphone like this and maximum volume does not really seems max (I always have to keep the headphone volume to max). For other good headphones used I found the loudness (max volume) is much much higher. So if you are into heavy metals and rock you may not find this headphone very useful.
- The bass quality is not too great
- Though it is actually an over the ear headphone, but I found it is a bit uncomfortable (atleast in hot and humid weather) when both the ears are covered for long time. That maybe also because I am used to inside the ear headphone mostly.
 Overall I feel it is okay to buy this headphone if you want to mostly attend calls and hear light music.",2020-06-15,3,12.0,https://amazon.in/Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones-Srhythm-Bluetooth/dp/B07F62W3TQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R182C2921COC6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F62W3TQ,2025-01-11T23:15:59.826976,Positive,0.9609390497207642

1. Build quality
- It's good for the price very good build but can break if fall or someone sits on it though build quality is great  I am using it very civil manner 😜 so mine one is absolutely fine.

2. Noise cancellation
- It's just a gimmick do not purchase for noise cancellation they do normal passive noise cancelation but this shouldn't be your purchasing decision for this headphone.

3. Bluetooth connectivity
- It works absolutely perfect for Mobile, Tab, and smart TV
- But with my PC it gets little connectivity issues but that's only for 1 out of 10 times but its Okay as I used it with Aux now Because my usage is high

4. Battery
- It was by buying decision for this headphone I purchase it for my online classes as I need great battery life and this headphone done this job absolutely perfect I got 17-18 hours of battery on the usage at sound 70% and its great believe me big battery life is must for any Bluetooth device and it's been 10 months now it's the battery is degraded as I was heavy user now it gives around 13-15 hour. so I recommend to use it with AUX if you are going to use it for a very long period it will save your battery

5. Sound quality

- I purchase it for battery life and I thought sound quality will be okay and it doesn't matter to me as I will be using it for classes but I was wrong the sound quality is soo good u will find this level of sound quality in the expensive headphone for the sound quality it's 10/10.

6. Now some prons that pissed me of
- It got an issue only with PC while connecting I have to connect and disconnect more than 3 times. but there can be Issues with my PC also IDK because this problem only happen with PC only work fine on another device
- After connecting it with AUX headphone buttons and the mic doesn't work it only works on Bluetooth mode and it totally ruins the experience with AUX u can only use it for listening with AUX, not for Video calls, normal calls, and online multiplayer game Like pubg as mic doesn't work so U have to connect it Bluetooth to unlock all these features
- U can't use it in summers if u have no AC in your room U will end up with lots of sweat if You use It so consider this also because If you're going to use it in a room without AC and u are living in a city like Delhi then don't purchase it.",2021-12-07,4,54.0,https://amazon.in/Boat-Rockerz-550-Headphone-Aesthetics/dp/B0856HNLDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3VXSMZ7Z5YFX5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0856HNLDK,2025-01-11T23:29:15.581634,Positive,0.6446110010147095

The sponge covering torn of completely after 1 year of usage and one side of the headphone broke while taking them  off my head, Really like the audio quality. One more thing I like to include is the charging port, it's built very loosely, you have to bend the whole cable and keep it tight near the port to charge.

Pros: Audio quality is just awesome, u can use these headphones while listening to music ans gaming(with aux cable) too.

It's is really comfortable near the ears and ear doesn't hurts after 5-6hrs of continuous usage.

 Battery life is also good I used to charge once in 4-6days and mostly used bluetooth.

I did paired(Bluetooth only) it with my laptop and mobile at same time but headphones only process one device sound at a time so I had to mute other time to time to shift onto devices. So u have to manage this thing.

It pairs with device easily without any issue or without taking much time. The aux cable is good too not too tight or too loose just perfect.

Head adjustment mechanism is kinda funny because the headphones moves side to side faster when u take headphones out of adjustment idk why, could be less friction.

While gaming with aux cable on u can get 0 latency(no sound delay) and can differentiate between lefts and rights and it's really helpful.

I don't know the weight of headphones but they feels light on head so u can play games or watch movies without headache

Cons: Build quality, full plastic body with only metal strip on head adjustment band and the plastic quality is ok ok...(cuz it broke ;-;)

Charging port is loosely fitted so you have to sacrifice your cable life span

Cushion are comfy but the skin or we say covering starts to fall off after some time and the headphones looks like dog water.

High latency in Bluetooth mode making it use aux cable while gaming only and if u dont have aux cable port in your device so just quit these headphones and look for something else.

Looks too big on head so won't recommend for gym, walk usage.

The 10mm drivers deliver clear audio with balanced bass, making music, podcasts, and calls a pleasure. Whether I’m listening to soft melodies or bass-heavy tracks, the sound is crisp and immersive. 🎵

The in-built mic is a great addition, ensuring clear communication during calls without any issues. I’ve used these earphones for both meetings and casual conversations, and the performance is flawless.

The 3.5mm audio jack offers wide compatibility, and it works perfectly with my phone, laptop, and tablet. Plus, the comfort of the earbuds is worth mentioning – they fit snugly without causing any discomfort, even during extended use.

What I love the most is how lightweight and durable these earphones are. The cable is of decent length and doesn't tangle easily, which is a huge bonus. For such a budget-friendly price, ZEBRONICS has nailed it with both quality and performance!

If you’re looking for reliable, everyday earphones that offer great sound at an affordable price, the Zeb-Bro is an excellent choice.

Let's start with the positives. The earphones provide a snug fit, ensuring comfort even during long listening sessions. The 10mm drivers deliver satisfactory sound performance, allowing you to enjoy your favorite music and audio with clarity. The passive noise cancellation feature is an added bonus, as it helps immerse you in your audio experience by reducing external noise distractions.

Connecting the earphones to your device is a straightforward process. Simply plug in the 3.5mm audio jack, and within a few seconds, the earphones sync with your phone or tablet, ready to deliver audio.

On the downside, the build quality of the earphone cable raises concerns. Some users have reported that the wires are not as sturdy as expected, making them susceptible to damage and tangling. This weakness in the wire construction may impact the longevity of the earphones, requiring extra care and attention during use and storage.

The ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones come in a sleek design and are available in multiple color options, including Black, Blue, Green, Red, and White, allowing you to choose the one that suits your style.

In terms of technical specifications, the earphones have an impedance of 16 Ω and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable length provides adequate flexibility for comfortable usage.

It's important to note that these earphones come with a 6-month warranty, which provides some assurance in case of any manufacturing defects or malfunctions within the specified period.

In conclusion, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit, making them suitable for everyday use. However, the durability concerns surrounding the wire strength are worth considering. If you prioritize longevity and robustness in your earphone choice, you may want to explore other options. Nevertheless, if you handle them with care, these earphones can provide an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point.",2023-07-14,4,121.0,https://amazon.in/ZEBRONICS-Zeb-Bro-Earphones-Compatible-Green/dp/B09R24JBYV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdt_img_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R28ZJ801LKCB5Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09R24JBYV#R28ZJ801LKCB5Z,2025-01-11T23:31:05.810483,Positive,0.9261402487754822

Whether it's about sound quality, bass or design and weight of course.

I too have boat's neckband(with prize 8-10 times more than its) and using both for long time.
The sound has a little variation in terms of bass and quality of course(what else we can expect in this price 😁₹180) but good for daily use.

The only negative side I will point out is about the quality of the product. The wire quality is not upto the mark (3/5), you have to handle it carefully and the earbuds are made of plastic material.
Also the the button in the microphone is not at all useful, sometimes it works only to stop ongoing songs but you can't increase or decrease the volume.

Overall I'll give it 4✨under the price I bought.

An important suggestion:-
If you find this product under the range of ₹200.And dont want to go for some high rate earhones, just go for it. It would be a good product to you. Otherwise, you can check out for some other earphones under 500.
Some of them are boat or MI earphones and boult audio bass earphones. 👍

I am using this since last 2 and a half weeks.My review so far is:Sound : 5/5Build quality: 4/5Mic quality: 3/5Battery: 5/5Volume control: 5/5ANC: 4/5I will rate this overall 4.5/5I am not much bothered about mic quality because that’s not my primary use. I got this only for music and it’s serving up to the mark.Duel device connection works well.Battery life with ANC will declines little bit fast, although I am using it mostly without ANC.ANC: It works just fine, it’s a budget ANC headphones so I don’t expect much. Those who have used proper ANC headphones might find this one less efficient. For me it works fine.Music: Well what can I say? I had used sony a lot in the past, but was pre bluetooth era. This was really a great experience for me. EQ works really well and you can actually spot a difference when you adjust the difference. Sound is crisp and clear. You can really hear all the instruments clearly. Vocals are crispy too, not too much not less they have this little sweet spot! Bass is really great too, although you have to boost it a little bit, but basic settings may also work for you.App: So far I found app working well, you can connect and disconnect devices within app as well. EQ settings work well too, you can basically create your own custom EQ ( recommended for audiophiles). App looks little cluttered I guess they will change it in future.Volume: It is crazy loud given the size of drivers they have. I have only used it at 50% volume most of the time when I am at home, hardly went to 70% in public without any ANC. But I recommend you to use ANC if you are surrounded by too much noise in public.Size and Fit :These are over the ear, so they fit perfectly fine over your ears. I was actually surprised how good they fit over my ears. Cushions are very well made, have good texture and soft enough to not hurt your ears. The headphones are big enough to be recognised from a distance.Downsides:I really hoped they could have given carrying case because headphones themselves are sturdy but they still need protection while carrying.Also these are not foldable, so carrying them can be little difficult, you may have to purchase a separate carrying case.",2024-10-25,5,11.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point-Connection/dp/B0BS1QCFHX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2NSGPM3JJXTIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS1QCFHX#R2NSGPM3JJXTIO,2025-01-11T23:32:52.980146,Positive,0.8604043126106262
"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- Black",B0BS1QCFHX,R1XZW9OSQEARGJ,"Big Hype for Big Price, Not recommended",Sandy,"I bought this during the Great Indian Festival, and the price was slashed down to 7,998 from its usual price of 9,999. I also got a 10% discount on my SBI card, so the price was close to 7,190. Delighted with the deal, I ordered the black color as my favorite blue was priced 2,000 INR more. I got it delivered within two days, thanks to fast delivery by Amazon, of course, probably if you are a Prime member. After using it for the first 15 minutes, I wasn't quite impressed. I called Amazon Customer Care, but they refused to accept the return, so if you want to buy from Amazon, be sure to try it at a local Sony Shop or Mall if it's available there. So being unable to return the product, I was forced to continue with it, and here are the things I noticed:Sound quality - To date, based on all the headphones and earphones that I have used, I think it is one of the best. I haven't used top-of-the-line headphones from Sony, Bose, Apple, etc., so the sound quality, based on my audio experience was pretty good. Also, some reviews say it is close to XM5, though there is a slight discernable difference in clarity.Sony App and EQ Settings- I tried to fine-tune the music to my hearing taste, and the music sounded a bit better. The app asked for a picture of my ear to adjust the sounds according to the acoustics of my ears. I found these features a bit overhyped. While there were some changes in audio, and some features may indeed work, most of these things are hyped as stand-out features for marketing purposes to attract consumers. Also, I have tried using the headphones without these settings, and although there was some difference, it sounded good even without these fine-tunings.ANC - It cancels out some noises in the background like the buzzing fan on my ceiling, but it's unable to cancel out the sound of my family members speaking around me, the TV audio (even though it is quite far in the drawing room and I am sitting in my bedroom), so it can cancel noise upto a certain degree beyond that it is of no use. I had watched a lot of Tech Reviews of various under 10k headphones before going for this one, they all have a similar problem, ANC works only up to a certain dB of noise, though it is understandable. If you want better ANC, probably go for higher-priced headphones.Dual pairing and call quality - I use my headphones for many purposes like calling for meetings, listening to music, watching YouTube videos, movies, etc. So, a dual-pairing headphone would have been very much useful for me. While I considered this headphone, this was also one of the features that I had in mind. But the result was disappointing; dual pairing works, but the sound quality deteriorates severely. According to my research, in dual pair mode, it doesn't use the LDAC codec; rather, it uses the SBC/AAC codec, resulting in a deterioration of sound and call quality. In many cases, the person on the other side couldn't even hear clearly what I am saying. So, the call and music quality are both below average, or you may even say poor in dual pairing, which makes this feature irrelevant.Connectivity - While in dual pair mode, it also experienced connectivity issues. There were times when the headphones got disconnected, and I had to manually switch or reconnect them. Contacting Amazon's customer care regarding this issue didn't help.Battery life - Before I purchased this, I had seen tech reviews claiming it has amazing battery life. But when I used it (I use it for office work as well as for my entertainment, so I use it 8-12 hours a day), I found that the battery life is not that great. I use it without ANC most of the time as I am working from home. The battery ran for about 3-4 full days, which is 30-35 hours, much below what Sony claims.Comfort - I have heard in many YouTube tech reviews that it is comfortable, but actually I found it quite opposite. In my opinion, ANC headphones under 10k are a big waste of money, especially if you are in hot and humid regions of India. The reason is that due to ear padding and isolation, your ears will heat up within 30 minutes and sweat, so you have to remove the headphones. Also, even though its padding is soft it's quite tight on the ear, and after 30 minutes of use, it causes discomfort, and you have to remove it.  So, I can't say it's very comfortable. Unless you are working in air-conditioning most of the time in hot and humid climate, it's better to look for TWS buds. If you are looking for noise-cancellation headphones, look for passive noise cancellation headphones that comes at much cheaper price with matching sound quality; there are a few below 3,000 INR which truly sound equally well.So, to summarize - In my opinion, it is a big hype for the big bucks you spend. If you get this for more than 7,000 INR, it doesn't seem worth it unless you like the brand name. If you are keen on quality ANC headphones then raise your budget; otherwise, at this price, I don't think I am fully satisfied with what it offers.",2023-10-17,1,124.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point-Connection/dp/B0BS1QCFHX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1XZW9OSQEARGJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS1QCFHX#R1XZW9OSQEARGJ,2025-01-11T23:32:52.980146,Positive,0.8115282654762268

"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- Black",B0BS1QCFHX,R1OY3ATGXO5QJL,Balanced sound output in this budget of 6190/-,Istiak Alam,"I am using it continuously for last 6 months and gave it 5🌟 overall for the things it offers in the price of just 6k... Yes 6k is just the initiation of good quality ANC bluetooth over the ear headset, people are expecting XM or bose or Sennheiser quality in 6k or 8k,lol....if it's in 8k or 10k range i would give it 4🌟 instead. Here's my findings —Pros:-1. Sound output - 4.5/5 ... Default sound is pretty flat, but quickly gets interesting after playing with eq, dsee, anc etc. . Sound volume is pretty average but distortion in max vol. is low. It's a general purpose headset, good enough for all aspects like rock, pop, bass,instrumental, classical, rap etc. . Seperation is nice, different tones have distinct identities. But for specific needs like for bass or vocal, strech your budget a bit more. I don't think you can get better than this balance of sound output in this budget.2. ANC - 4/5 actually it's pretty decent, but could be a little better. Afterall it's an entry level ANC.3. Built - 4.5/5 simplistic plastic built, no fancy cosmetics, but solid and mature, very much flexible, not gonna break anytime, good elasticity for sticking with head. Though it's plastic built but has stainless steel housing around stretchable arms which is very nice to have for long term usage. Most headsets break from this sections.4. Battery- 5/5 fabulous battery life even with anc on . Charging it like smartphones from 20 to 90% and getting about 1 week to 10 days of battery life with intense usage. Charging takes about 50 mins for the above session.5. Comfort - 4/5 nice padded ear cups, but brings sweat quickly and then feels a bit warm... But prolonged usage doesn't hurt that much as once i had used it about 2hrs at a single strech.6. Connectivity- 5/5 very strong bluetooth connectivity, works seamlessly even with 10 meters of distance with walls and different floors.But still not that useful for online gaming via wireless mode as it has a little bit of latency.Cons. :-1. Crap when connected to PC via wire and headset turned off.2. Like other over the ear, gets uncomfortable in scorching summer and humid conditions.3. Lack of ldac , hence no hi-res audio, but in this price bracket it's ok.4. Though doesn't feel cheap, but some aesthetics should be there.Verdict:- You can absolutely go with it if you are getting it around 6000/- for no specific taste. Don't expect it to outperform those ult or XMs, it's illogical to think. If you want the ultimate one then there are XM, momentum, quitecomfort or those beyerdynamics....instead of going with intermediates, either go with this one or go with those super expensive ones. And those people comparing it with much lower priced headphones and saying it worse, they simply don't have the sensitivity to differentiate between subtle frequencies, and those subtle frequencies make it sweet.'Made for iPhone/iPod' written on the outside of the box, which is strange, probably will work better with ios than android.

"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- Black",B0BS1QCFHX,R1AJLBNNANB200,Great with quirks,Azhar JuMan,"I've been using it for a while and I'm satisfied with the sound quality and the noise cancelling. It has good enough passive noise cancelling already for everyday use and the active noise cancelling makes it amazing to use in noisy environments like a flight or train or even a really loud fan in your room. Music quality is not 'amazing' but it's better than most and nothing to complain about. Battery life is good, and charges back up pretty quick too. Buttons are easy and intuitive to use. Fit and comfort is there, it's closed back so might be uncomfortable to use in hot/humid conditions.One thing I'm most impressed about is the bluetooth range,  I can keep my phone in my room and walk around wearing the headphones to the next room or the bathroom and it loses no signal, it's great. The strong bluetooth signal unfortunately seems to mess with wifi though, so I see some reduction in wifi speed when this is connected. Could just be a weakness of the wifi chip in my old phone though.Another quirk is that by default only 2 noise cancellation modes - ambient, and NC (noise cancellation) - were available in the headphones. I had to install the sony headphones app to enable the 3rd mode - off - which is what I use most of the time. Ambient mode lets outside sound like voices in so you can hear people talking even when you're wearing the headphones, but outside of that it sounds noisy and I don't use it all that much. And NC mode is full noise cancellation. If you want to turn it off altogether and use it as a passive headphones you have to install the app and enable the 3rd option.Overall very happy with my purchase.",2024-10-26,5,2.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point-Connection/dp/B0BS1QCFHX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1AJLBNNANB200/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS1QCFHX,2025-01-11T23:32:52.980146,Positive,0.9615022540092468
"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- Black",B0BS1QCFHX,R20PHSNVCLO50B,I am satisfied with my purchase.,Mohit,"I got it delivered to my home on 26th of October. Since then I am using it , I wanted to test it thoroughly before I write my review.Build quality: it is well build considering the price 8k which I paid. Though it is all plastic but it is by no means cheap at all. Fit and finish is top notch. The slider is also really good. No problem there.Padding is good too and it is comfortable to wear because it is light weight (187g).Try not to slide down unless your head is small or you are a female. The more you slide down, the more you will feel the pressure around your ears.It seems that it can last 8+ years easily if taken care of them.Suggestion: Buy a case for this, I bought it for 499 and it is perfect (UniGear Extra Hard Shell Headphone Carrying Case )Features and sound quality:Anc: you can expect around 50 to 60% reduction in sound. It's ambience mode is good but not really natural.Sound Quality: They are really good, not great though but definitely above average. You will feel worth spending 8,000. But above that might not be much of a value.Very crispy and crystal clear audio. Listen to all types of song and it absolutely fabulous. But listen through a good source I mean through Spotify or Apple music or any paid music platform then only you can actually hear the true sound quality.Equaliser: Download load the app and you can either use one of the presents it has in the app or you can make your own. I made my own ...0, +3, +6, +7, +5 and -1 ( bass) for clasic music and for other I like to have +3 (bass) with these settings.I find that these settings makes the mids more alive and clear.I didn't find any connection lost issue or any problem with the blutooth connection.I have watched 2 movies wearing these and the experience is almost like a little theatre. I mean you hear background in so much details, the bass and other sounds just perfect, making the watching movie a very delightful experience.I have sony earbuds wf-c500 and I find my recent purchase is an absolute upgrade.

"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- Black",B0BS1QCFHX,R36U1PQEZTODKN,"Average at best, SONY's premium price",Amazon Customer,"After much debating on cost to quality ratio between this, XM4 and XM5 (all Sony offerings) and reading tons of reviews here, I settled for this, since it seemed like a balanced option for non-audiophiles. After spending a good amount of time with them, I'm ready to share my thoughts.First and foremost, let's talk about what Sony has always been known for: sound quality. These headphones do not disappoint in this department. The audio is crisp, clear, and well-balanced, delivering a pleasurable listening experience across a variety of genres. The bass can be punchy but not overwhelming, the mids are smooth, and the highs are sharp without being piercing.Now, onto the aspect that was a bit of a letdown: the active noise-cancelling. The ANC is, to put it bluntly, below average. This is surely a disappointment since I have seen it struggle with noises even at home, including that of fan. Forget, if you TV on or anything, you would be able to hear all of those noises (though slightly suppressed). I have had ANC over ear headsets before. However, cross checking between this and them, I did feel this does perform slightly better, but that said, yes, dont expect the world to silent by any means. I also found that, though the headphones are light and comfortable, you will definately sweat in them and feel your ears burning after sometime, esp during summer and humid places.Another point worth mentioning, is I found, which i tilt or move my head, the ANC gets disturbed and you will occasionaly for split seconds notice background noises before ANC resumes again.The build quality of the headphones is solid, with a design that's sleek and minimalistic, and they are comfortable enough for long listening sessions (except summers maybe!). The battery life is also commendable, easily lasting through a full day of use. There is no case, so take good care of them!Multidevice works good and decent. There could be lags. I have noticed the headsets dont auto switch off (maybe during mutipoint connect).",2023-10-26,3,5.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point-Connection/dp/B0BS1QCFHX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R36U1PQEZTODKN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS1QCFHX,2025-01-11T23:32:52.980146,Positive,0.9401290416717529

"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- Black",B0BS1QCFHX,R1QBQVT83EUQJW,Good but read the following before you finalize it,Aritra Kumar Saha,"After going through various reviews & videos the reason for me going for the Ch720n were three things : The durability, ease of use and sound quality.Kindly note the following pointers before you finalise this as your go to set of headphones :1. The sound quality out of the box is not great at all. I had to twerk the eq settings on the sony sound connect app before it started sounding better. The sound dramatically improved with my ""Sound"" app that's free on playstore.2. If you are into electronica or other modern bass heavy music, the bass becomes a bit too much for this set of headphones to handle.3. The build quality is excellent with soft cushiony earcups and the presence of physical buttons makes it easier for me to operate.4. The battery life is excellent and there are no complains regarding it.Overall, if you're looking for the best set of headphones under 10k, this would be it but I would still not be comfortable spending more than 6k on these. However, with the Soundcore space one as it's competitor in this price range which offers many features that this does not have, I would still opt for these solely because of the sound quality and durability.Peace",2024-12-10,4,1.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point-Connection/dp/B0BS1QCFHX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1QBQVT83EUQJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS1QCFHX,2025-01-11T23:32:52.980146,Negative,0.45329341292381287

It automatically disconnects from one device in less than a minute.
Two devices dont stay connected for greater than a minute, the device in which media is not playing gets disconnected
To connect to the first device again
1) i have to disconnect from the second device
2) unpair(yes unpair) it from the first device
3) restart the headphones re-pair in the first device as if connecting for the first time to make it work
Repeat the same steps everytime you want to switch between devices.
After digging through reviews and comments on YouTube this is a issue with every unit not only mine
Also auto connectivity sometimes works sometimes doesn't work
Aux cable is a joke, only left side audio is delivered, the pin is too long to inside some devices so doesn't work on them
2000 rupees product advertised as bluetooth headphones having it's basic functionalities flawed is unacceptable.

Regarding sound quality: Its mediocre, there is a noticeable distortion at higher volumes, bass is non existent, even though I don't like bass that much there is serious lack of bass, i have to adjust it with equalizer to make it decent
Faint sounds are barely hearable even at max volume
This is my first time using headphones and i can figure out flaws quite easily
My rockerz 255 neo neckband has far superior sound quality
So anyone with even a remote love for audio quality or any dual device work should not consider buying this

Comfort : it's okayish,  i get sweaty inside earcups, for me it works like over-ear(completely covers from top to bottom end) but my ears are also very small in size
Weight is manageable(idk what to expect never used one before). It gets slightly uncomfortable after an 30 mins or so on ears. Personally i get jaw pain.
Battery : good
Build/Durability : good for now, also this is a
PU leather, it will wear and tear as usage continues + cushions doesn't seem replaceable (which is fine at this price)
Latency : good i would consider it for gaming, u will get used to it
In conclusion i regret buying it, i bought it mainly for long time usage and dual device connectivity, both of which are not full filled

The sound quality is absolutely incredible – rich, deep, and crystal clear. The mic performs great, making calls smooth, and the sound isolation helps me stay focused on my studies. As a student, it's a perfect choice, especially when compared to brands like Noise or BoAt in the same price range. The premium feel of these headphones really stands out.

What really sets the Blash Max apart is the design. The 180-degree rotation ensures they stay safe from damage when not in use, unlike other headsets that can break or tilt. The soft cushions and matte finish make long online classes and study sessions comfortable. Plus, they're ideal for outdoor activities, traveling, and gym workouts – they won’t fall off like buds, which is a huge bonus. Covering the full ear, they provide a much better experience than typical on-ear headphones.

The build quality is fantastic, and the customer support team is quick and responsive if you ever need assistance. The only slight drawback is the charging time, but once charged, the call quality is premium and clear, and the music is immersive. What really impressed me is the touch controls – something you rarely find in other brands at this price.

"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- Blue",B0BXXPG6FP,R2NSGPM3JJXTIO,Great Product,sayan,"I got this at 7999 with debit card cash back. I am using this since last 2 and a half weeks.
My review so far is:

Sound : 5/5
Build quality: 4/5
Mic quality: 3/5
Battery: 5/5
Volume control: 5/5
ANC: 4/5

I will rate this overall 4.5/5
I am not much bothered about mic quality because that’s not my primary use. I got this only for music and it’s serving up to the mark.
Duel device connection works well.
Battery life with ANC will declines little bit fast, although I am using it mostly without ANC.

ANC: It works just fine, it’s a budget ANC headphones so I don’t expect much. Those who have used proper ANC headphones might find this one less efficient. For me it works fine.

Music: Well what can I say? I had used sony a lot in the past, but was pre bluetooth era. This was really a great experience for me. EQ works really well and you can actually spot a difference when you adjust the difference. Sound is crisp and clear. You can really hear all the instruments clearly. Vocals are crispy too, not too much not less they have this little sweet spot! Bass is really great too, although you have to boost it a little bit, but basic settings may also work for you.

App: So far I found app working well, you can connect and disconnect devices within app as well. EQ settings work well too, you can basically create your own custom EQ ( recommended for audiophiles). App looks little cluttered I guess they will change it in future.

Volume: It is crazy loud given the size of drivers they have. I have only used it at 50% volume most of the time when I am at home, hardly went to 70% in public without any ANC. But I recommend you to use ANC if you are surrounded by too much noise in public.

Size and Fit :
These are over the ear, so they fit perfectly fine over your ears. I was actually surprised how good they fit over my ears. Cushions are very well made, have good texture and soft enough to not hurt your ears. The headphones are big enough to be recognised from a distance.

Downsides:
I really hoped they could have given carrying case because headphones themselves are sturdy but they still need protection while carrying.

Also these are not foldable, so carrying them can be little difficult, you may have to purchase a separate carrying case.",2024-10-25,5,11.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-WH-CH720N-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point/dp/B0BXXPG6FP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2NSGPM3JJXTIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BXXPG6FP#R2NSGPM3JJXTIO,2025-01-11T23:38:19.986735,Positive,0.6668257713317871
"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- Blue",B0BXXPG6FP,R1J65WZ5ZSG0B6,Impressive Sound Quality and Decent Noise Cancellation,Sadhna,"I recently purchased this headphone and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is truly remarkable, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience that brings my music and podcasts to life. Whether I'm jamming to my favorite tunes or engrossed in a podcast, the clarity and depth of the sound are truly impressive.

One of the standout features for me is the microphone's noise cancellation capabilities. While it may not completely eliminate all background noise, it does a commendable job of reducing ambient sounds during calls. The result is clear and crisp communication without the distractions of external noise. It's perfect for virtual meetings and online gaming sessions where effective communication is key.

The design of the headphone is sleek and comfortable, making it suitable for extended wear. The over-ear cups provide a snug fit without causing discomfort, and the adjustable headband ensures a customized and secure fit. The build quality also feels robust, indicating durability for everyday use.

I appreciate the user-friendly controls that allow me to adjust volume, skip tracks, and manage calls effortlessly. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, providing a stable connection with my devices without any noticeable lag.

Overall, this headphone is a solid choice for anyone seeking a combination of excellent sound quality and decent noise cancellation. It strikes a great balance between performance and affordability, making it a valuable addition to my audio gear.

"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- Blue",B0BXXPG6FP,R1OY3ATGXO5QJL,Balanced sound output in this budget of 6190/-,Istiak Alam,"I am using it continuously for last 6 months and gave it 5🌟 overall for the things it offers in the price of just 6k... Yes 6k is just the initiation of good quality ANC bluetooth over the ear headset, people are expecting XM or bose or Sennheiser quality in 6k or 8k,lol....if it's in 8k or 10k range i would give it 4🌟 instead. Here's my findings —

Pros:-

1. Sound output - 4.5/5 ... Default sound is pretty flat, but quickly gets interesting after playing with eq, dsee, anc etc. . Sound volume is pretty average but distortion in max vol. is low. It's a general purpose headset, good enough for all aspects like rock, pop, bass,instrumental, classical, rap etc. . Seperation is nice, different tones have distinct identities. But for specific needs like for bass or vocal, strech your budget a bit more. I don't think you can get better than this balance of sound output in this budget.

2. ANC - 4/5 actually it's pretty decent, but could be a little better. Afterall it's an entry level ANC.

3. Built - 4.5/5 simplistic plastic built, no fancy cosmetics, but solid and mature, very much flexible, not gonna break anytime, good elasticity for sticking with head. Though it's plastic built but has stainless steel housing around stretchable arms which is very nice to have for long term usage. Most headsets break from this sections.

4. Battery- 5/5 fabulous battery life even with anc on . Charging it like smartphones from 20 to 90% and getting about 1 week to 10 days of battery life with intense usage. Charging takes about 50 mins for the above session.

5. Comfort - 4/5 nice padded ear cups, but brings sweat quickly and then feels a bit warm... But prolonged usage doesn't hurt that much as once i had used it about 2hrs at a single strech.

6. Connectivity- 5/5 very strong bluetooth connectivity, works seamlessly even with 10 meters of distance with walls and different floors.
But still not that useful for online gaming via wireless mode as it has a little bit of latency.

Cons. :-
1. Crap when connected to PC via wire and headset turned off.
2. Like other over the ear, gets uncomfortable in scorching summer and humid conditions.
3. Lack of ldac , hence no hi-res audio, but in this price bracket it's ok.
4. Though doesn't feel cheap, but some aesthetics should be there.

Verdict:- You can absolutely go with it if you are getting it around 6000/- for no specific taste. Don't expect it to outperform those ult or XMs, it's illogical to think. If you want the ultimate one then there are XM, momentum, quitecomfort or those beyerdynamics....instead of going with intermediates, either go with this one or go with those super expensive ones. And those people comparing it with much lower priced headphones and saying it worse, they simply don't have the sensitivity to differentiate between subtle frequencies, and those subtle frequencies make it sweet.
'Made for iPhone/iPod' written on the outside of the box, which is strange, probably will work better with ios than android. I'm an android user (pixel) though:).
At last, it's a sweet headphone.

"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- Blue",B0BXXPG6FP,R1AJLBNNANB200,Great with quirks,Azhar JuMan,"I've been using it for a while and I'm satisfied with the sound quality and the noise cancelling. It has good enough passive noise cancelling already for everyday use and the active noise cancelling makes it amazing to use in noisy environments like a flight or train or even a really loud fan in your room. Music quality is not 'amazing' but it's better than most and nothing to complain about. Battery life is good, and charges back up pretty quick too. Buttons are easy and intuitive to use. Fit and comfort is there, it's closed back so might be uncomfortable to use in hot/humid conditions.

One thing I'm most impressed about is the bluetooth range,  I can keep my phone in my room and walk around wearing the headphones to the next room or the bathroom and it loses no signal, it's great. The strong bluetooth signal unfortunately seems to mess with wifi though, so I see some reduction in wifi speed when this is connected. Could just be a weakness of the wifi chip in my old phone though.

Another quirk is that by default only 2 noise cancellation modes - ambient, and NC (noise cancellation) - were available in the headphones. I had to install the sony headphones app to enable the 3rd mode - off - which is what I use most of the time. Ambient mode lets outside sound like voices in so you can hear people talking even when you're wearing the headphones, but outside of that it sounds noisy and I don't use it all that much. And NC mode is full noise cancellation. If you want to turn it off altogether and use it as a passive headphones you have to install the app and enable the 3rd option.

Overall very happy with my purchase.",2024-10-26,5,2.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-WH-CH720N-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point/dp/B0BXXPG6FP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1AJLBNNANB200/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BXXPG6FP,2025-01-11T23:38:19.986735,Positive,0.9615022540092468
"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- Blue",B0BXXPG6FP,R20PHSNVCLO50B,I am satisfied with my purchase.,Mohit,"I got it delivered to my home on 26th of October. Since then I am using it , I wanted to test it thoroughly before I write my review.

Build quality: it is well build considering the price 8k which I paid. Though it is all plastic but it is by no means cheap at all. Fit and finish is top notch. The slider is also really good. No problem there.

Padding is good too and it is comfortable to wear because it is light weight (187g).

Try not to slide down unless your head is small or you are a female. The more you slide down, the more you will feel the pressure around your ears.

It seems that it can last 8+ years easily if taken care of them.

Suggestion: Buy a case for this, I bought it for 499 and it is perfect (UniGear Extra Hard Shell Headphone Carrying Case )

Features and sound quality:

Anc: you can expect around 50 to 60% reduction in sound. It's ambience mode is good but not really natural.

Sound Quality: They are really good, not great though but definitely above average. You will feel worth spending 8,000. But above that might not be much of a value.

Very crispy and crystal clear audio. Listen to all types of song and it absolutely fabulous. But listen through a good source I mean through Spotify or Apple music or any paid music platform then only you can actually hear the true sound quality.

Equaliser: Download load the app and you can either use one of the presents it has in the app or you can make your own. I made my own ...
0, +3, +6, +7, +5 and -1 ( bass) for clasic music and for other I like to have +3 (bass) with these settings.

I find that these settings makes the mids more alive and clear.

I didn't find any connection lost issue or any problem with the blutooth connection.

I have watched 2 movies wearing these and the experience is almost like a little theatre. I mean you hear background in so much details, the bass and other sounds just perfect, making the watching movie a very delightful experience.

I have sony earbuds wf-c500 and I find my recent purchase is an absolute upgrade. So definitely happy with my purchase.

Hope I have covered everything.",2024-11-11,5,7.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-WH-CH720N-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point/dp/B0BXXPG6FP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R20PHSNVCLO50B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BXXPG6FP,2025-01-11T23:38:19.986735,Positive,0.9178879261016846
"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- Blue",B0BXXPG6FP,R1XZW9OSQEARGJ,"Big Hype for Big Price, Not recommended",Sandy,"I bought this during the Great Indian Festival, and the price was slashed down to 7,998 from its usual price of 9,999. I also got a 10% discount on my SBI card, so the price was close to 7,190. Delighted with the deal, I ordered the black color as my favorite blue was priced 2,000 INR more. I got it delivered within two days, thanks to fast delivery by Amazon, of course, probably if you are a Prime member. After using it for the first 15 minutes, I wasn't quite impressed. I called Amazon Customer Care, but they refused to accept the return, so if you want to buy from Amazon, be sure to try it at a local Sony Shop or Mall if it's available there. So being unable to return the product, I was forced to continue with it, and here are the things I noticed:

Sound quality - To date, based on all the headphones and earphones that I have used, I think it is one of the best. I haven't used top-of-the-line headphones from Sony, Bose, Apple, etc., so the sound quality, based on my audio experience was pretty good. Also, some reviews say it is close to XM5, though there is a slight discernable difference in clarity.

Sony App and EQ Settings- I tried to fine-tune the music to my hearing taste, and the music sounded a bit better. The app asked for a picture of my ear to adjust the sounds according to the acoustics of my ears. I found these features a bit overhyped. While there were some changes in audio, and some features may indeed work, most of these things are hyped as stand-out features for marketing purposes to attract consumers. Also, I have tried using the headphones without these settings, and although there was some difference, it sounded good even without these fine-tunings.

ANC - It cancels out some noises in the background like the buzzing fan on my ceiling, but it's unable to cancel out the sound of my family members speaking around me, the TV audio (even though it is quite far in the drawing room and I am sitting in my bedroom), so it can cancel noise upto a certain degree beyond that it is of no use. I had watched a lot of Tech Reviews of various under 10k headphones before going for this one, they all have a similar problem, ANC works only up to a certain dB of noise, though it is understandable. If you want better ANC, probably go for higher-priced headphones.

Dual pairing and call quality - I use my headphones for many purposes like calling for meetings, listening to music, watching YouTube videos, movies, etc. So, a dual-pairing headphone would have been very much useful for me. While I considered this headphone, this was also one of the features that I had in mind. But the result was disappointing; dual pairing works, but the sound quality deteriorates severely. According to my research, in dual pair mode, it doesn't use the LDAC codec; rather, it uses the SBC/AAC codec, resulting in a deterioration of sound and call quality. In many cases, the person on the other side couldn't even hear clearly what I am saying. So, the call and music quality are both below average, or you may even say poor in dual pairing, which makes this feature irrelevant.

Connectivity - While in dual pair mode, it also experienced connectivity issues. There were times when the headphones got disconnected, and I had to manually switch or reconnect them. Contacting Amazon's customer care regarding this issue didn't help.

Battery life - Before I purchased this, I had seen tech reviews claiming it has amazing battery life. But when I used it (I use it for office work as well as for my entertainment, so I use it 8-12 hours a day), I found that the battery life is not that great. I use it without ANC most of the time as I am working from home. The battery ran for about 3-4 full days, which is 30-35 hours, much below what Sony claims.

Comfort - I have heard in many YouTube tech reviews that it is comfortable, but actually I found it quite opposite. In my opinion, ANC headphones under 10k are a big waste of money, especially if you are in hot and humid regions of India. The reason is that due to ear padding and isolation, your ears will heat up within 30 minutes and sweat, so you have to remove the headphones. Also, even though its padding is soft it's quite tight on the ear, and after 30 minutes of use, it causes discomfort, and you have to remove it.  So, I can't say it's very comfortable. Unless you are working in air-conditioning most of the time in hot and humid climate, it's better to look for TWS buds. If you are looking for noise-cancellation headphones, look for passive noise cancellation headphones that comes at much cheaper price with matching sound quality; there are a few below 3,000 INR which truly sound equally well.

So, to summarize - In my opinion, it is a big hype for the big bucks you spend. If you get this for more than 7,000 INR, it doesn't seem worth it unless you like the brand name. If you are keen on quality ANC headphones then raise your budget; otherwise, at this price, I don't think I am fully satisfied with what it offers.",2023-10-17,1,124.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-WH-CH720N-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point/dp/B0BXXPG6FP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1XZW9OSQEARGJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BXXPG6FP#R1XZW9OSQEARGJ,2025-01-11T23:38:19.986735,Positive,0.8115282654762268

Using it for 10 days now, don't have much complaints. I will sum up in pros and cons after my experience with the earphones. Reducing 1 star for the first CON in my review below.
PROS:
1) Cheaper than some of the other earphone brands with 12 months warranty as well.
2) Good Audio quality, I found it was better sounding than an Over the Ears Headphones I have from Cosmic Byte (G4000). Clear sound and good audio reproduction.
3) Battery life serves good at least for my taste as I am not a heavy user (I generally use it 2hours a day max.). Just FYI, I have charged the earphones twice in 10 days.
4) Comfortable earphones with very less weight and good ear fit.
5) Mic quality for calls is decent, not much noise cancellation for background noise but whatever is sent through is very clear and accurate.
CONS:
1) Biggest con for me personally is that I can't watch online youtube or twitch videos with this one (usually have to go 360p or lower for smoother experience) as it hampers the wifi speed on my mobile when connected to the mobile via bluetooth. This is happening because my wifi router is 2.4Ghz and it is interferring with the bluetooth signal to reduce internet speeds. A simple 5Ghz router would solve this issue, but as I don't have it, its become an issue. Also, I can tell if you run videos from mobile internet then you don't face this issue.
2) Only SBC bluetooth audio format supported hence not the best audio quality.
3) Left and Right ear plugs always confuse me while wearing it on, also the length of left and right side is not exactly the same, slight mismatch is present, which goes to show poor quality checks from the company.
4) Battery life could have been better or atleast charge time should have been reduced. It takes 1.5 hrs charge time for 6-8hrs battery life.
5) Battery indicator is very wrongly calibrated. From 100 to 70% discharging, it takes 5-6 hrs playtime, while from 70 to 10% it takes just 30 odd minutes. This again shows poor quality checks from the company.",2021-01-11,4,126.0,https://amazon.in/Tangentbeat-Bluetooth-Headphones-Waterproof-Cancelation/dp/B08D77XZX5,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1OR3V5IOZK882/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D77XZX5,2025-01-11T23:39:33.443324,Positive,0.9032455086708069

I'm still using an external software to adjust the equalization as the low end is too pronounced for my taste and seems overly present even for electronic music - I wish this feature was reduced in the future, or that an option to natively control it was given to the user.However, after two weeks of using, I noted several points that are very positive, which leads me to give a five-star review :- The headphones are really confortable and can be worn all day without fatigue.- The overall quality of sound (minus the bass being too present) is excellent for an item at this price (currently 7k).- The noise cancellation feature is quite weak in the treble, but works well with the mids and lows, and gives a lot of confort even without playing music when in noisy environments.- The battery life, and especially the fast charge, are great. It really behaves as advertised. For someone like me who struggles with charging his devices other than last minute, I'm over the moon with the ability to plug it for a few minutes and get a decent lifespan, enough to do a normal commute or fall asleep to music for example. That's really a gamechanger from other BT headphones I had before- The customer service is excellent and very reactive. I must say that for a product priced so competitively, I didn't not expect this quality of service.So all in all, after a second thought, I'm really recommending this product to anyone looking for a good price/quality headphones.",2024-12-02,5,9.0,https://amazon.in/Soundcore-Hybrid-Active-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B08HMWZBXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R21ZQO1155X478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HMWZBXC,2025-01-11T23:50:37.728685,Negative,0.5879603028297424

DO NOT PURCHASE,Charles S.,"I initially purchased the Soundcore Life Q30 headphones with high expectations due to their strong noise-cancellation features, good sound quality, and overall comfort. However, it didn’t take long for me to realize that durability is a major issue with this model.After a few months of use, the headphones developed significant structural problems that many other users around the world have also reported – a quick search online will reveal countless similar complaints. This is not an isolated issue and appears to be a widespread defect. Given the frequency of these complaints, I strongly advise potential buyers to reconsider purchasing this product.While the sound quality and features are impressive for the price, what good is a product if it doesn't last?

Finally I took a risk and bought it and following are my thoughts after using it for 10 to 15 days:
This price paid is worth every penny. These are truly another level of music sensation and vibe. If you are a bass lover and want something like ""a portable or chalta firta woofer"" buy this without a second thought. The punches are to a different level and trust me once u put them on, you Nirvana zone starts.
It has taken bass to another level and with the music clarity it produces is nothing compared to anyone as yet which I have used.
The voice controls are amazing.
The crusher is totally on a different horizon.. .the way it soothes you ears and the feel and vibe it will give you is from another world. You wouldn't want to plug inn anything else once you wear these.

There are no indian reviews yet on these headphones on youtube but lemme tell you,this is one of the most finest headset out here recently.
I am a bass lover. I was very skeptical to buy between momentum 4's or crusher anc 2. I went with these headphones and they sound beautiful. They really crush the head off in a good way with that thumpy bass wheel.
If u are base lover , just go for it without a 2nd thought. Your skull will literally rattle.You will fell like there are 2 subwoofers of car or dj system attached on your skull
I use this for playing pubg keeping audio codec in developer options to sbc.latency becomes low and enemy steps separation in game is also there.

I have bose qc earbuds and their sound is amazing but when i put on these headphones with bass wheel keeping to just on 60 percent i was literally amazed.Now i am not using my bose.Lol. This headphone is now my daily driver.I didnt expected the sound to be so good.

Please note - Use the feature of SOUND BY MIMI(personal sound). It really made the sound very good in every aspect for my ears.

I also use it for jogging in park.
The bass which is felt during song is really out of this world.
I played a mixture of bollywood, hollywood songs and this headphone sounded good for mostly all types of songs.no complaints.
I watched some hollywood movies and i felt every gun shot from movie directly in my head because of the sensory bass.
Even latency for games is low.
One of the best headphones in market.One of its kind.

Even audiofiles can use it for fun. The sound is not audiophile grade but anyways everyone can have fun with these cans if u r a basehead.",2023-10-20,5,18.0,https://amazon.in/Skullcandy-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Compatible/dp/B0C9L8ZR6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZQ74H8YTKC4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C9L8ZR6Q,2025-01-12T00:02:45.346601,Positive,0.9591893553733826

and before you judge me on my listening habits I listen to metal and believe me I listen to Sony mdr xb55 and many Sony products which last a year and other high quality ones like one plus, earfun and costliest one etc but this is the thing I absolutely implore you to buy this one you won't be disappointed

pros

1. good connectivity I have usb c cable phone
2. noise cancellation is top notch
3 I can't speak for vocals as it doesn't really matter to me and other opinions differs and I'm sure everyone is entitled to their opinions
4. buttons for pause next track and previous track
5. fits sturdy on year I listen mostly while on pillow side so its comfier

cons

1. vocals could've been better but I don't expect it you get what you pay for
2. maybe the functionality breaks like one eaphone might not hear properly but it depends on usage I think
3. idk about my mac connectivity but will update soon
4. mic could've been better but that's okay I don't really use it I buy just for music so that's okay i think

nothing else just enjoy it while you can I'll buy 500 rs a year rather than but 1500 headphone which barely last me 1.5 years and no better sound thanks for reading and I hope you found my review helpful, cheers",2024-11-28,5,,https://amazon.in/boAt-Bassheads-100-Microphone-Compatibility/dp/B0D7PXB3SH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3N5IKC1D00YZ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7PXB3SH#R3N5IKC1D00YZ1,2025-01-12T00:03:44.160754,Neutral,0.4065922796726227

Unfortunately, they fell short of my expectations.
The sound quality was underwhelming, with a lack of clarity and depth. The bass was weak and overpowered the other frequencies. The tangle-free cable was a convenient feature, but it didn't compensate for the poor audio quality.
While the in-ear fit was comfortable, the overall build quality felt cheap and flimsy. The earphones didn't feel durable, and I was concerned about their longevity.

Using it for 10 days now, don't have much complaints. I will sum up in pros and cons after my experience with the earphones. Reducing 1 star for the first CON in my review below.
PROS:
1) Cheaper than some of the other earphone brands with 12 months warranty as well.
2) Good Audio quality, I found it was better sounding than an Over the Ears Headphones I have from Cosmic Byte (G4000). Clear sound and good audio reproduction.
3) Battery life serves good at least for my taste as I am not a heavy user (I generally use it 2hours a day max.). Just FYI, I have charged the earphones twice in 10 days.
4) Comfortable earphones with very less weight and good ear fit.
5) Mic quality for calls is decent, not much noise cancellation for background noise but whatever is sent through is very clear and accurate.
CONS:
1) Biggest con for me personally is that I can't watch online youtube or twitch videos with this one (usually have to go 360p or lower for smoother experience) as it hampers the wifi speed on my mobile when connected to the mobile via bluetooth. This is happening because my wifi router is 2.4Ghz and it is interferring with the bluetooth signal to reduce internet speeds. A simple 5Ghz router would solve this issue, but as I don't have it, its become an issue. Also, I can tell if you run videos from mobile internet then you don't face this issue.
2) Only SBC bluetooth audio format supported hence not the best audio quality.
3) Left and Right ear plugs always confuse me while wearing it on, also the length of left and right side is not exactly the same, slight mismatch is present, which goes to show poor quality checks from the company.
4) Battery life could have been better or atleast charge time should have been reduced. It takes 1.5 hrs charge time for 6-8hrs battery life.

I have these earphones from 4 months and these haven't tangled since. Also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives a nice  looking effect.But 1 thing I have seen is the middle piece which have a mic and buttons is 180 degree reversed. so, many times it's difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing. But it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easy.Now about the main part the internalsThe sound quality is so so nice. 😊As you can see in my title. Solid 8/10. You can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when it's time for a party you can listen rock, bass boosted songs with such a adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap prices.Bass quality is also good.perfect for the ears. And if u want high bass, I tried it with max bass it can produce and that's awesome. But don't listen high bass for long. Those can hurt ur ears really bad.But noice cancellation is 4/10.seems like there is no noice cancellation. Maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpiece.Obviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost 2000. But I will choose this product instead of a 1500 one or less than 1500 because this cost less than 500 or sometimes less than 400(depends on sale) but quality and services of these products are not less than of a 2000 rs earphone.In past, 1 of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous, there services are so cool and quick. So those got replaced within 3 days. (it's 3 days because I forgot the eslip, if you mail them with everting ready it won't take more than 2 working days)It's an honest review by me and I will definitely suggest you to but these. ☺️🙃Edited:-Their services are slower now. Don't know why and it takes around 1. 5week to 2 weeks to get the refund. If something happens to ur earphones.Also its been like 1 year as of 1-9-21And I saw some trend with it. My brother earphones stop producing sound from one side evey 4 months or soBut mine earphones be with me for 5 months.It's not a problem though cause you can mail 'em regarding this. This happened with me even with extra proper care of the earphone.Still the best earphones, you can find at this price point",2021-03-02,5,423.0,https://amazon.in/Boom-Ultima-Headphones-Cancelling-Earphones/dp/B08D75R3Z1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1FHCHWONZZ0YJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D75R3Z1#R1FHCHWONZZ0YJ,2025-01-12T00:07:28.524196,Positive,0.9246243238449097

Music quality is Good, Bass is not a thumping one, you will have to press them hard into the ear to feel it but then slowly your ears will start paining. Treble is ok. Mid Ranges take priority.

If you enable EQ with higher bass and increase the volume above 75%, you can get a good ear massage as the whole unit starts vibrating with a bad output.

I am using this with a Redmi Note 8 Pro with PowerAmp.

> I don't know anything about the workings of the Noise cancellation properties in this headset. I have used noise cancelling headphones earlier and this has nothing of that sort.
> the earphones are too delicate, I am not sure they will take the beating of a harsh use.
> purchased it for Gym use, has no clip to hold the microphone unit in place.

and before you judge me on my listening habits I listen to metal and believe me I listen to Sony mdr xb55 and many Sony products which last a year and other high quality ones like one plus, earfun and costliest one etc but this is the thing I absolutely implore you to buy this one you won't be disappointed

pros

1. good connectivity I have usb c cable phone
2. noise cancellation is top notch
3 I can't speak for vocals as it doesn't really matter to me and other opinions differs and I'm sure everyone is entitled to their opinions
4. buttons for pause next track and previous track
5. fits sturdy on year I listen mostly while on pillow side so its comfier

cons

1. vocals could've been better but I don't expect it you get what you pay for
2. maybe the functionality breaks like one eaphone might not hear properly but it depends on usage I think
3. idk about my mac connectivity but will update soon
4. mic could've been better but that's okay I don't really use it I buy just for music so that's okay i think

nothing else just enjoy it while you can I'll buy 500 rs a year rather than but 1500 headphone which barely last me 1.5 years and no better sound thanks for reading and I hope you found my review helpful, cheers",2024-11-28,5,,https://amazon.in/boAt-Bassheads-100-Microphone-Compatibility/dp/B0D7PXB3SH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3N5IKC1D00YZ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7PXB3SH,2025-01-12T00:08:35.051689,Neutral,0.4065922796726227

Thanks to ammazon and the seller, got delivery within 12 hrs.
I expected alot more in sound quality, but was disappointed for the price paid. Using it now for over 2 weeks and the battery is still going strong. Do not expect fireworks from the sound which is tuned a bit above neutral hence i found it bassy with less treble but music and vocals are extremely clear. These hp definitely require a burn in for a few hours and are now sounding a bit better. The earcups are small and you need to adjust your ears to them. It does get uncomfortable after about 90 mins and if you sweat, god save you. The ANC is a joke and is utterly useless as even with it on you can hear everything. However, with ANC off, the audio is horrible. You feel as if you are listening to a rs. 200 hp. With ANC on, the sound gives you the oompf. Bluetooth connection is great.
Overall, these hp are not worth the full price of 14000 even at the discounted price of 8000 not that good. A sony or skullcandy sounds better. It does serve the purpose of good sound at times. If they sell for lower than 7000 then go for it.

Customisation thru official android app - good part of the buy
Got it around 6300 INR during sale, another good part. and i still feel i should have got a better product in such spending. Neverthless, i wont really pay anything more than 6 for such product. (talking in Hindsight)
Quality of music is the same in bluetooth and also wired mode.Please note - the aux cable is not normal aux cable - it is extremely customised for the headphone. So, dont lose it or break it. You will feel the pinch to shell out few dollars for buying another one from the company. No option!

Cons
1. It will pain after an hour or two.
2. Can't use if for long period, unlike some reviews mentions so which i feel is completely wrong. And i still wonder how they could have written that thing in their review.
3. It says 30 hours battery, but I dont think it lasts longer than 15-17 hours. Am damn sure it wont last beyond 20 hrs.
4. The pouch that comes along with the product is literally useless. The customer will be pleased if a good pouch that can really protect the product while carrying it and it will make total sense to bundle it with the product.
5. ANC is a joke. (I have borrowed words of other reviews as i felt the same)
6. The ear cushions could have been better and little larger to fit the earcups inside the cushions. The material seems to be not appropriate for hot geographical territories like India. I certainly feel it sweats a lot after wearing it for 45 mins or so on a continuous basis.

It's not a head-turner, but it looks quite premium. Yes it's all plastic, but the good quality type. Great decision to have the outside ears be empty and have a matte finish.

Fit and Portability: Very tight and snug fit, with holes that are surprisingly small for an 'over ear' headphone. People with big heads or ears might face some discomfort with long usage, but for the majority it should be absolutely fine. It folds up into a small form factor, and comes with a decent carry case for daily use. Sadly, the ear cups don't completely swivel, which makes carrying it around on the neck slightly uncomfortable.

Sound: Compared to it's competitors (Sony, Soundcore), it has a neutral sound signature, with a mild bass boost. Not recommended for those who want thumping bass, but for everyone else it's a pleasant sound.  Sound quality is brilliant as expected from Sennheiser, as long as you're using the higher quality Bluetooth codecs (Aptx for Android and AAC for Apple/Windows). Pro tip - Use the app ""Wavelet"" if you have an Android phone, you can use the AutoEQ feature to smoothen out the sound even more!

Mic: Same as most Bluetooth headphones. Good enough for phone/video calls but don't expect to go and record anything serious with it.

Noise Cancellation: ANC performance is above average. It will block out most of the droning, lower pitched sounds (ACs, Car Engines etc.), but you can still hear people talking and other higher pitched sounds. Lack of a ""transparency mode"" outside of phone calls is a negative, hopefully it's available later with a firmware update.

Controls: Slightly challenging to initially learn (lots of buttons bunched together), but it's pretty logical, and eventually you'll get a hang of it. Voice Assistant button works as expected, as long as it's properly setup.

Battery: Holds up to the claimed 30 hours quite easily. As long as you're charging it every few days, you never have to worry about it running out.

App: Thankfully, Sennheiser are pretty good at keeping the smartphone app maintained and regularly updated. The app recently got an overhaul, and the headphones got a firmware update that added a feature (Sidetone). Wish there were more options for EQ rather than a simple 3 band thing.

Price: The SE model (which I have) is great value for money; a newer model in a cheaper price. The regular 450BT seems slightly overpriced, as it's older, yet more expensive.

Overall, the 450 has both pros and cons, but it comes out as a net positive. It's a good  recommendation for an entry level ANC device, that offers Sennheiser's trust and quality.

Respectable competitors in the 8-10k price range (as of writing this review) are the Sony WH-CH710N and Soundcore Q35.

After researching for a bit, I zeroed in on this piece of beauty.

Here's my user experience having used it for over 3 weeks now.

1. The sound quality is 9/10. The output is well balanced as per my liking.

2. Noise-cancellation works really well. It doesn't block out the entire outside noise but does a great job cancelling out the ambient noise in my room, especially the AC humming. I would rate this 9/10!

3. The microphone quality is pretty good for calls. The speech as well as any musical instrument sound is transmitted pretty well. I would rate it 8/10!

4. The battery life is brilliant. This headphone stays connected to the laptop or my phone for 12-14 hours a day. A full charge easily lasts me 3-4 days of functioning before it needs to be recharged. I would rate it 9.5/10!

5. The Bluetooth connectivity is amazing. I could easily move around in my house to the rooms where the WiFi signal struggles to reach, but this headphone stays connected without a drop in the connectivity. I would rate this 9.5/10!

6. Lastly, the build quality is quite good. The cushioning of the band above the head is just about right. While, the cushioning of the earmuffs are perfect! They neatly cover my earlobes and doesn't cause too much discomfort when wearing them for long hours. The clamping force is not too tight. The only time I had to move them was to wipe off sweat.

In summary, I would recommend this headphone to whoever is looking to buy a noise-cancelling, wireless headphone in under 10k budget. There are other brands available with similar products, but I tend to gravitate towards Sennheisers as this is my 4th Sennheiser product and they usually last quite long, depending on how you use it.",2022-06-26,5,16.0,https://amazon.in/Sennheiser-Wireless-Headphones-Active-Cancellation/dp/B083T4XJDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R22LTS9435BVIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B083T4XJDY,2025-01-12T00:09:59.688489,Positive,0.9209275245666504

1. this sequeezes your head a lot, you either have to get used to it, or not buy this at all.
2. noise cancelling just doesn't work. turning it on adds some white noise to the music or whatever is playing and that is effective in eliminating nothing.
3. turning on noise cancellation makes the music sound bad.
4. volume on wired connection is more than than when listening on wireless.
5. battery percentage is shown only in multiples of 10. i.e., only 60%, 70%, 80% etc, nothing in between 70 and 80, or 60 and 70.
6. no latency can be observed on bluetooth 5+ devices(with iphone 12), but older devices with bluetooth 4+ has latency issues, with both devices playing from same distance.
7. connection drops at times.
8. multi-device feature is useful, but headphone can't switch between devices instantly, needs 3-4 seconds. this is an issue because, when you are listening to something on computer and you get a phone call, you can instantly take the call. but, the case with media(e.g, music) is different. when multiple devices are connected and you are playing something on one device and then you play something on 2nd device, it just plays but you can't hear that and you will be listening to sounds from 1st device. there is neither indication on your 2nd device it can't be played, nor does the headphone switches to second device. for headphone to passthrough properly. you first need to pause/stop sounds from 1st device, then wait a couple of seconds and then start playing on 2nd device.
9. the ear cups can't accommodate adult's ears. they are too small and will squash you ears.
10. i don't know if this is happening only with me, but my left ear touches the insides of earcups, which doesn't happen from the right earcup.
11. the slider needs hard drags to function, for ex, to change tracks, to take calls.
12. lot of voice prompts for the playback time left. this gets frustrating if you use this for long sessions.
13. heard from a friend who used 4.5BT for around 2 years that the sweat will tear aprat the ear cushions. so, a big no-no for long sessions. and on amazon, ear cushions selling at 23-27% of the actual product is ridiculous(i bought 450SE for INR 7,490).

GOOD:
1. sound quality is very good for the price.
2. microphone quality is acceptable for phone calls and zoom, but nothing more. microphne sounds quiet on older devices with bluetooth 4+, but has acceptable volume with bluetooth 5+ devices.
3. wired passthrough feature has to be my favourite.
4. battery life is adequate. i have only had to charge this around once every 3-4 days with headphone turned on for around 10 hours every day and with 0-2 devices connected and playing for at least half of that time.
5. build is good, so i presume this is going to last long squeezing my ears and head.

But that's the only and not that major plus point of these headphones. (My 2K worth earbuds sound same or even better in some scenarios. 😑)

One of the worst Bluetooth connectivity I've seen on an audio device. It let's you connect 2 devices simultaneously but if one of them get's out of range or disconnect, the headphones will continuosly tell you ""LOST CONNECTION"". And this can only be stopped if you reconnect the device or turn off the headphones.

There is no Noice Cancellation. So don't buy these is you want good noice cancellation. (ANC gets good as you pay more, note it down).

If you connect to a device specially laptop, you need to be in range of within one meter to stay in connection! With that frustration you end up using the wired connection! I paid nearly 9K for a wireless Bluetooth headphones, but if I have to use wire then what is the benefit here.

The mic is good though, on calls the person on other end can hear you clearly. 👍

And, the app does nothing. I have received only one firmware update in 3-4 months. So if you not use the app then you are not missing much.

Finally I would not recommend these headphones. Buy any other cheaper headphones as there is no differentiation with these compared to other brands.

At such an affordable price, I wasn’t expecting much, but boy, was I pleasantly surprised.

Build Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ The headset feels surprisingly sturdy. The materials used are better than expected, and it doesn’t creak or feel flimsy. The adjustable headband fits comfortably, and the ear cups have just the right amount of padding.

Sound Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ While not mind-blowing, the sound quality is definitely a notch above what you’d expect from a budget headset. It won’t replace your high-end audiophile gear, but for everyday use, it’s more than satisfactory.

Comfort: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ The ear cushions are soft, and the clamping force is just right. No sore ears here!

Comparisons: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ I’ve owned headsets from a tier above, and honestly, the ZEBRONICS Boom Wired Headphone holds its ground.

Final Verdict: If you’re on a tight budget but still want decent build quality and comfort, give the ZEBRONICS Boom Wired Headphone Over-Ear Headset a shot.

I have only used earphones before. I'm writing this because I'm unsure what to expect for this price. I bought them for Rs.4000. In this one year, I can say that I have used these headphones a lot and have a few points to say about it.Pros -1. Battery life - They mention it's 50 hrs and it is. I have completed the series ""Peaky Blinders"" on a single charge with 20% battery remaining. That's some next-level battery life, considering the driver's size.2. Sound quality - The sound quality (excluding the bass) is pretty good, what some would say is a classic JBL signature.3. Comfort - It is very comfortable. As I said, I come from an earphone background, so it took a while to get used to it.4. Dual-device connectivity - This feature is a blessing and works effortlessly. But it only works effortlessly on Windows. I have an Android (Samsung) phone and tried connecting it with Windows(10/11) and Linux (Debian) systems as well. I faced some hiccups on the Linux side, but that can be due to incompatible audio drivers.5. Charging Speed - It takes more than an hour to charge from 0 to 100. But a quick 10-minute charge can last for hours.Cons -1. Sound quality (Bass) - It's too low. You can feel it only at higher volumes (&gt;85%).2. Built quality - I don't know if I can expect a well-built headphone at Rs.4000. It is comfortable, but after a few hours of continuous usage, my ear gets sweaty, and I have to remove them for a few minutes. And all of this from staying indoors. DO NOT use this outdoors for jogging or running or at the gym. I tried my best to keep them away from sweat or wet hair, but as you can see from the photos, the leather (or whatever that material is) starts to deteriorate. The stitching of the right ear cup suddenly gave up one day. I tried to fix it using fevicol (glue), and you can see how they look from the photos.3. Over-the-ear - It is not over the ear. I have tried a few over-the-ear headphones, and this is not it. I think I have a decent-sized ear, and the rims of my ear touch and sometimes get folded by the inner cushion of the ear cups of this headphone. These are a little bit smaller to be called over-the-ear headphones.Conclusions -1. Don't buy this if you sweat a lot or plan to take this outdoors.2. Don't expect bass from it. My Rs.500 earphone (Realme Buds 2) has more bass than this.3. Other than bass, the sound is good.4. They are not fully Over-the-ear. So, some people might feel uncomfortable.5. A decent pair of headphones, but I expected a better-built quality for Rs.4000.",2023-10-05,4,83.0,https://amazon.in/JBL-Playtime-Charging-Headphones-Assistant/dp/B096G2RN6D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2CP58M01VVTH1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096G2RN6D,2025-01-12T00:12:51.364526,Neutral,0.46254709362983704

So the cost I'm going to mention is totally relative to my experience. Real  cost can be differentNoise Cancellation: Very poor it seems Rs200 was spend for this purpose.Sound Quality: its really Awesome! Everythig is True. No artificial Bass. The sound quality will definetly make you happy. At 70% sound level then it will reduce the environmental noise significantly. It seems around Rs 1500 was spend to produce such a good quality sound.Battery Life: Again This is also perfect. When it was delivered the charge was 70% and after 5 days of moderate use the charge level is 30%. Also it provides fast charging so definitely they have spend around Rs 700 for battery lifeComfort: It's comfortable. Sometimes you may need to adjust but if you doing some work and at the same time wearing this then you may find that you have not weared a headphone(if the music is off😂) but if you are playing a music then you can focus on your work more ! So they must have spend Rs. 700 for this.Build Quality: No need to worry for a normal use and it can withstand normal accident like slipping from palm or falling from small height. So they have spend Rs. 300 to make it robust.Others: looks is good, AUX cable available, sound leakage is very low But Bluetooth connectivity is not advanced",2021-05-27,5,4.0,https://amazon.in/JBL-Playtime-Charging-Headphones-Assistant/dp/B096G2RN6D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2YS3QW9ZGVVNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096G2RN6D,2025-01-12T00:12:51.364526,Positive,0.763542115688324

"Noise Airwave Max 4 Wireless Over-Ear Headphones with 70H Playtime, ENC, 40mm Driver, Low Latency(up to 40ms), Dual Pairing, BT v5.4 (Carbon Black)",B0CY2377YW,R3D5NP2Z6QDZK2,**Product Review: Comprehensive Look at These Budget-Friendly Headphones**,epikgamedev,"After nearly a month of using these headphones extensively (10-12 hours daily), I can confidently say that they deliver impressive performance, especially considering the price range. Here’s a detailed breakdown of their strengths and minor drawbacks based on my experience.

### Comfort and Long Usage
One of the highlights is the comfort level; even after prolonged use, the fit remains snug without causing discomfort, which makes them ideal for long listening sessions. This aspect is especially notable given that many headphones in this range tend to fall short on comfort for extended wear.

### Sound Quality
The audio quality is balanced, with a satisfying clarity in both mids and highs. For casual listeners and music enthusiasts alike, these headphones provide a pleasant sound profile.

However, there are some nuances:
- **Volume and Sound Leakage**: The volume output is robust, though after the 50-60% mark, there’s noticeable sound leakage, which progressively increases as the volume rises. At full volume (100%), the sound is uncomfortably loud, and the bass becomes highly pronounced, creating a tactile vibration that can be felt upon touching the headphones. While this bass emphasis might appeal to bass lovers, it’s not ideal for balanced listening at maximum volume. Additionally, at this level, the leakage is substantial—effectively turning the headphones into mini speakers that can be heard across a room. This is not conducive to a private listening experience, but it is manageable when the volume is kept at 80% or below.

- **Low-Volume Performance**: On the flip side, these headphones perform admirably in quiet environments; I can listen comfortably at just 10% volume and still hear everything clearly, even in a room with background noise from a fan. For my regular usage, I find 30% volume is perfect for music, while 60% works well for videos and movies.

### Battery Life
Battery life is another area where these headphones shine. The manufacturer’s claim of 70 hours holds true. I’ve been charging them every 4-5 days despite rigorous usage, and they consistently deliver, making them reliable for extended listening sessions without frequent recharging.

### Dual Pairing Capability
A standout feature is the **dual pairing capability**, which works seamlessly. I can connect both my PC and mobile simultaneously, and the headphones automatically switch audio sources based on activity. When I press play on one device, media playback on the other device automatically pauses, ensuring a smooth, uninterrupted experience. Additionally, the headphones will automatically pause media playback if a call comes in, making them versatile and convenient for multitasking across devices.

### Controls and Connectivity
The buttons on the right side are intuitive and well-placed, making it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks, and take calls without fumbling. The included aux cable for wired mode works well for most setups, though the cable length may be a bit short for desktop connections.

### Value for Money
For their price range, these headphones are highly competitive. While other options might prioritize crowd-pleasing, bass-heavy sound profiles, these provide a more balanced output that doesn’t overshadow other frequencies. Combined with the impressive battery life, they stand out against alternatives that may compromise longevity for exaggerated bass.

### Final Verdict
For anyone looking for affordable headphones that don’t sacrifice sound quality or comfort, these are an excellent choice. They are especially suited for listeners who appreciate balanced sound, dual-device functionality, and long battery life. However, if you’re sensitive to sound leakage or plan to use them frequently at high volumes, this is something to consider. Overall, I would recommend these headphones for their solid performance and great value.",2024-11-14,5,15.0,https://amazon.in/Noise-Launched-Wireless-Headphones-Playtime/dp/B0CY2377YW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3D5NP2Z6QDZK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CY2377YW#R3D5NP2Z6QDZK2,2025-01-12T00:15:59.323142,Positive,0.9615060687065125

Pros:

*Build Quality: The body is made out of plastic which feels durable. The joints from where the headphones extends are made from plastic but reinforced with metal and gives a promising feel. Overall sturdy build for the price range.

*Battery Life: The battery lasts impressively long on a single charge – easily gets me through days without needing to recharge. for the fact i have recieved these headphones with around 70% charge and since then i have charged these headphones only twice that too only for around 30 mins.

*Sound Quality: The clarity and balance of sound is really good with Clear mids and highs. you can easily feel all the different instruments while listening to the music. The bass is also really good i wont say these are bass oriented headphones tho.

*Comfort: The fit is really good for my head and the headphones are Lightweight and actually comfortable for extended wear. you can easily bingewatch wearing them. Best thing is the Soft ear pads that don’t press too hard.

*Connectivity: Bluetooth connects instantly and Dual pairing works smoothly across my laptop and phone. although i have faced very few Dual pairing fails where it gets disconnected from both the devices and keeps on reconnecting untill you restart the connections.

Cons:

*Microphone: the microphone quality in these headphones are really bad and can sometimes be unusable if you are to talk slowly or when in outdoors

overall if your budget is around 2500....you can go for these headphones which were really good for music and movies.

My main purpose was to use headphones for a long duration and no compromise in sound quality........
And this satisfies the purpose very well.....
The issue I found is with the amazon packaging......
There were no bubblewraps nothing except an outer packaging or box. I ordered 2 things and got the same issue with the packaging.
Due to this my headphones has got minor scratches and wear marks.

Otherwise this is a great product.... If you want better sound quality and can use in ear earphones go for IEMs ........
IEMs will offer a tremendous upgrage in the sound quality........

The base is really good...... I was previously using Oppo Enco M32 Neckband. And can tell that the Oppo ones sound good than this, also they are 1000rs cheap.

It automatically disconnects from one device in less than a minute.
Two devices dont stay connected for greater than a minute, the device in which media is not playing gets disconnected
To connect to the first device again
1) i have to disconnect from the second device
2) unpair(yes unpair) it from the first device
3) restart the headphones re-pair in the first device as if connecting for the first time to make it work
Repeat the same steps everytime you want to switch between devices.
After digging through reviews and comments on YouTube this is a issue with every unit not only mine
Also auto connectivity sometimes works sometimes doesn't work
Aux cable is a joke, only left side audio is delivered, the pin is too long to inside some devices so doesn't work on them
2000 rupees product advertised as bluetooth headphones having it's basic functionalities flawed is unacceptable.

Regarding sound quality: Its mediocre, there is a noticeable distortion at higher volumes, bass is non existent, even though I don't like bass that much there is serious lack of bass, i have to adjust it with equalizer to make it decent
Faint sounds are barely hearable even at max volume
This is my first time using headphones and i can figure out flaws quite easily
My rockerz 255 neo neckband has far superior sound quality
So anyone with even a remote love for audio quality or any dual device work should not consider buying this

Comfort : it's okayish,  i get sweaty inside earcups, for me it works like over-ear(completely covers from top to bottom end) but my ears are also very small in size
Weight is manageable(idk what to expect never used one before). It gets slightly uncomfortable after an 30 mins or so on ears. Personally i get jaw pain.
Battery : good
Build/Durability : good for now, also this is a
PU leather, it will wear and tear as usage continues + cushions doesn't seem replaceable (which is fine at this price)
Latency : good i would consider it for gaming, u will get used to it
In conclusion i regret buying it, i bought it mainly for long time usage and dual device connectivity, both of which are not full filled

I'm still using an external software to adjust the equalization as the low end is too pronounced for my taste and seems overly present even for electronic music - I wish this feature was reduced in the future, or that an option to natively control it was given to the user.However, after two weeks of using, I noted several points that are very positive, which leads me to give a five-star review :- The headphones are really confortable and can be worn all day without fatigue.- The overall quality of sound (minus the bass being too present) is excellent for an item at this price (currently 7k).- The noise cancellation feature is quite weak in the treble, but works well with the mids and lows, and gives a lot of confort even without playing music when in noisy environments.- The battery life, and especially the fast charge, are great. It really behaves as advertised. For someone like me who struggles with charging his devices other than last minute, I'm over the moon with the ability to plug it for a few minutes and get a decent lifespan, enough to do a normal commute or fall asleep to music for example. That's really a gamechanger from other BT headphones I had before- The customer service is excellent and very reactive. I must say that for a product priced so competitively, I didn't not expect this quality of service.So all in all, after a second thought, I'm really recommending this product to anyone looking for a good price/quality headphones.",2024-12-02,5,9.0,https://amazon.in/soundcore-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Headphones-Reduction/dp/B0C6KFZC9Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R21ZQO1155X478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C6KFZC9Z,2025-01-12T00:17:54.042715,Negative,0.5879603028297424

It automatically disconnects from one device in less than a minute.
Two devices dont stay connected for greater than a minute, the device in which media is not playing gets disconnected
To connect to the first device again
1) i have to disconnect from the second device
2) unpair(yes unpair) it from the first device
3) restart the headphones re-pair in the first device as if connecting for the first time to make it work
Repeat the same steps everytime you want to switch between devices.
After digging through reviews and comments on YouTube this is a issue with every unit not only mine
Also auto connectivity sometimes works sometimes doesn't work
Aux cable is a joke, only left side audio is delivered, the pin is too long to inside some devices so doesn't work on them
2000 rupees product advertised as bluetooth headphones having it's basic functionalities flawed is unacceptable.

Regarding sound quality: Its mediocre, there is a noticeable distortion at higher volumes, bass is non existent, even though I don't like bass that much there is serious lack of bass, i have to adjust it with equalizer to make it decent
Faint sounds are barely hearable even at max volume
This is my first time using headphones and i can figure out flaws quite easily
My rockerz 255 neo neckband has far superior sound quality
So anyone with even a remote love for audio quality or any dual device work should not consider buying this

Comfort : it's okayish,  i get sweaty inside earcups, for me it works like over-ear(completely covers from top to bottom end) but my ears are also very small in size
Weight is manageable(idk what to expect never used one before). It gets slightly uncomfortable after an 30 mins or so on ears. Personally i get jaw pain.
Battery : good
Build/Durability : good for now, also this is a
PU leather, it will wear and tear as usage continues + cushions doesn't seem replaceable (which is fine at this price)
Latency : good i would consider it for gaming, u will get used to it
In conclusion i regret buying it, i bought it mainly for long time usage and dual device connectivity, both of which are not full filled

Rating: 1/5

I recently purchased the Airdopes Progear, expecting a high-quality audio experience. Unfortunately, this product has been a major letdown.

Poor Sound Quality:

The sound quality is subpar, lacking depth and clarity. The audio is tinny, with no noticeable bass. Even at maximum volume, the sound remains weak and unimpressive.

Key Issues:

1. No Bass: The absence of bass is staggering. Music and videos lack the punch and energy that bass provides.
2. Distortion: Audio distortion is noticeable, especially at higher volumes.
3. Muffled Sound: Voices and instruments sound muffled, lacking definition.
4. Unimpressive Treble: The treble is overpowering, making the overall sound unbalanced.

Design and Comfort:

While the design is sleek and compact, comfort is compromised. The earbuds feel bulky, causing discomfort during extended wear.

Battery Life:

Battery life is average, lasting around 4-5 hours on a single charge.

Connectivity:

Bluetooth connectivity is stable, but pairing can be finicky at times.

Conclusion:

The Airdopes Progear failed to meet my expectations. With poor sound quality, lack of bass, and uncomfortable design, I wouldn't recommend this product.

*Final Verdict:*

Avoid the Airdopes Progear if you prioritize sound quality. Invest in better alternatives for an immersive audio experience.",2024-11-14,1,25.0,https://amazon.in/boAt-Airdopes-Progear-Open-Ear-Conduction/dp/B0D7MJ2KD1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RXOTLQJV8XIWZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7MJ2KD1,2025-01-12T00:43:44.082888,Negative,0.9404025673866272

I love that I can still hear what’s happening around me, which is great when I’m out jogging or biking. The fit is secure, so they don’t fall out, even when moving around a lot. They’re also sweat-resistant, so they hold up well during workouts.

The sound quality is surprisingly good, with a nice bass kick, and calls are clear, even when I’m in a noisy place. The battery life is amazing—I’ve gone days without needing to charge them, and even if the battery’s low, a quick 10-minute charge gives you hours of playtime. The Bluetooth connects quickly and stays connected without any fuss, so it’s been really convenient.

There’s also this gaming mode that reduces the lag, which is cool for watching videos or gaming without that annoying delay.

1.Very comfortable to wear all day long.
2. Light weight. Feel nahi hota kaan pr laga hua hai.
3. Keeps one fully aware of surroundings. Logon se aaram se baat kr sakte ho.
4. Decent battery backup. Lasts for around 12 hours. Can be used on one ear at a time. So usable time can be extended upto 50 hours with charging.
5. Sound quality is good. Though don't expect exceptional bass and treble (obviously) as it doesn't go inside ear canal and hence no chances of ear infection and irritation.
6. Great for working people.
Dislikes:
1. Uncomfortable to wear inside helmet
2. Cannot be used while riding 2 wheelers due to wind noise.
3. Touch functions not good. I prefer buttons.
4. Outside noise is a very big problem as it's based on open air conduction. So no question of any kind of noise cancellation.
5. Mic reception is weak for noisy places.

1. Sound Quality: The sound is impressively balanced and clear, with bass that’s deep but doesn’t overpower the rest. Whether it’s classical or hip-hop, everything sounds crisp and full.

2. Noise Cancellation: Bose really nails it with the ANC—it’s strong but smart, adjusting as needed to block out the world. Transparency mode also feels natural, like you’re not wearing headphones at all.

3. Comfort: Super comfy! Lightweight with soft ear pads, these are perfect for long listening sessions without any ear fatigue.

4. Battery Life: Lasts up to 24 hours with ANC on, and a quick charge is there when you need it. Reliable for travel or just a busy day.

5. Connectivity: The Bluetooth is stable, and it can connect to two devices at once, so you can switch between your phone and laptop easily.

 Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones hit all the marks clear sound, amazing noise cancellation, and lasting comfort. They’re a solid pick if you want premium headphones for serious listening.

"Bose QuietComfort Ultra Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Headphones with Spatial Audio, Over Ear Noise Cancelling Headphones with Mic, Up to 24 Hours of Battery Life, Diamond - 60th Anniversary Edition",B0D4ZCH5HS,R3L8EQIOSUEYB9,Buy Other Sound Equipment,Arvind,"I have been using the AirPods Pro 2 daily and the Shokz OpenRun for walks and the gym.

I was considering getting a pair of headphones (1) for better sound quality and (2) for better noise cancellation.

I went ahead with the purchase on October 19th at a price of approximately ₹22,000.

Mistakes/assumptions:

 1. A higher price means better performance: The AirPods Max still uses Apple’s H1 chip. Despite its exorbitant price, it doesn’t compete with the AirPods Pro 2, which uses the Apple H2 chip. Mark Ellis Reviews has done a video on this, and I compared sound quality reviews against these as a benchmark.
 2. Being a class leader in ANC means their sound quality must also be somewhat on par.
 3. Not doing A/B testing for sound quality before buying.

I was listening to music on my AirPods when I received the delivery. My first impression upon wearing the Bose QC Ultra was disappointment in how lackluster the sound quality was. I tried adjusting the EQ but didn’t notice much of an improvement.

I tried out its unique selling point (USP), Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), but it was nothing remarkable.

Immersive Audio: A gimmicky attempt at replicating Apple’s Spatial Audio. It sounds very processed and artificial, unlike Spatial Audio, which feels natural.

Popping sound when walking: There is a noticeable popping sound when walking, which makes the headphones usable only while at your desk. There is a Reddit thread indicating that this is a known issue.

Tips for achieving high-quality output:

 • On the Apple Music app, turn on Hi-Res Lossless.

TL;DR:

 • Noise cancellation: 8/10
 • Sound quality: 2/10
 • Spatial Audio (Immersive Audio): 1/10

In terms of sound quality, the AirPods Pro 2 and Shokz are in a different league compared to the Bose QC Ultra, which, even if sold for ₹5,000 to ₹8,000, is not worth the price.

Note: There are no returns after purchase.

Update : Bose is refusing to address the popping sound issue. Amazon will be checking with them and are expected to get back to me by 5th of November. Will update the progress here.",2024-10-20,1,7.0,https://amazon.in/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0D4ZCH5HS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3L8EQIOSUEYB9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4ZCH5HS,2025-01-12T00:57:17.508604,Positive,0.6351454257965088

If you’re someone who likes to listen to a balanced sound signature as opposed to bass heavy headphones, then this is the perfect product for you. I am not saying that bass is poor on these headphones, you can definitely hear it but you may not feel that extra thump you might find on Sony products. The noise cancelling is just out of the world. For flights and long bus journeys, the headphones will drown out enough of the ambient noise to let you sleep peacefully. The ear cups and headband are soft and comfortable enough for long hours of listening. The ear cups are also really deep so most ear types won’t touch the driver enclosure. The Bose app is also well designed and easy to use. The immersive audio feature is great for certain songs and for watching shows, but it won’t work well with every song. I prefer to have it turned off to get more battery life. I can get a week’s worth of battery out of each charge (I listen to music for about 3-4 hours per day at 50-60% volume). The hinges and other components of these headphones feel sturdy and well built. You can go ahead and get these without a second thought. However, if you’re someone who makes a lot of phone calls from your headphones, or if you’re a bass head, you might want to consider other options like the XM5, since they have better microphones and a warmer, bass heavy sound signature.",2024-10-22,5,3.0,https://amazon.in/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0D4ZCH5HS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R32V6A63QZMJP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4ZCH5HS,2025-01-12T00:57:17.508604,Positive,0.6864978075027466

I’ve got this one just about 24 hrs back, thanks to Amazon Shopping Festival with Axis Bank credit card, I landed up paying around ₹25,300/- for it.
The delivery experience with Amazon Prime was flawless and the product delivered within 36 hrs of placing the order.
Packing is good and reminds of Apple unboxing.
The first thing that comes to mind on using the product is its weight. Perhaps the lightest in its category. The head cushion is comfortable and even after using it for 2-3 hrs at a stretch one shouldn’t feel uncomfortable.
The battery charging is quick, from ~50% to full charge taking around 30 mins with a Type C fast charger.
Bluetooth connectivity is seamless with iPhone and the first-time pairing happens effortlessly.
However, while comparing with the Apple AirPod ProMax that am using since a year, the spatial sound experience is not as great. The additional volume control buttons in Apple is more convenient. Besides, with the Apple product, it switches seamlessly between all Apple devices based on what you’re attending to, something this doesn’t.
Overall, it’s a good product for single device usage, perhaps better than most others in its category, but definitely falls short of Apple.
Thought of adding this additional aspect after over a month of using the product. While using the headphone and listening to anything on your phone, every time a call comes, you’ll have to manually select your headphone for attending it, unlike on my Apple AirPod Max, where it automatically shifts to the call and back.",2024-09-30,4,3.0,https://amazon.in/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0D4ZCH5HS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RLHGHQLT6B02B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4ZCH5HS,2025-01-12T00:57:17.508604,Positive,0.9699380397796631

Anche dopo lunghi periodi di utilizzo, quasi non si percepiscono addosso.

Il suono, come tipico di JLab, è caratterizzato da bassi pronunciati, ma qui sono accompagnati da una chiarezza notevole. A differenza di altri prodotti del marchio, dove il basso può risultare confuso, qui è ben definito e piacevole.

I padiglioni auricolari sono progettati in modo naturale e si adattano comodamente all'orecchio, ma il grip sulla testa non è eccezionale. Tendono a scivolare facilmente, rendendole poco adatte per l’uso in palestra o in movimento.

La batteria promette fino a 70 ore di autonomia e il cavo di ricarica USB-C incluso è di buona qualità, un aspetto positivo.

Un punto debole significativo è l’assenza di sensori capacitivi sui lati, che avrebbero potuto migliorare l’esperienza utente, magari con una funzione per attivare rapidamente la modalità ""Be Aware"" o Transparency. Questa mancanza è un’occasione persa per rendere il prodotto ancora più versatile.

In generale, cuffie leggere, confortevoli e con un suono ben bilanciato, ma con margini di miglioramento sul design e le funzionalità.",2024-12-27,4,,https://amazon.in/JLab-Headphones-Cancelling-Customizable-Compatible/dp/B0CRM4Q1W1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2U1C1XCTTHT1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRM4Q1W1,2025-01-12T01:00:57.963645,Neutral,0.859732449054718

I need ANC. I also sometimes have to fly, and cannot handle the incredible noise onboard airliners. I ordered JBL on-ear, and blessed a friend with them. Then ordered with Amazon Warehouse Deal the Bose QuietComfort 45, expecting Bose to be the audio connoisseur provider pur sang. Massive disappointment. Noticeable hiss of ANC and totally not HiFi sound. Switched to an Amazon Warehouse Deal Sony flagship WH-1000XM4. Painful headband, and again a hiss, and no HiFi sound. Almost gave up... And as for noise in airliners: None of these make it quiet. I end up wearing both earplugs and ANC in all of them. Choose to give JLAB a last change. Excellent price, excellent wearing comfort, wonderful HiFi sound experience, and no hiss. Slightly weaker in ANC performance, but still wholly adequate.

The 10mm drivers deliver clear audio with balanced bass, making music, podcasts, and calls a pleasure. Whether I’m listening to soft melodies or bass-heavy tracks, the sound is crisp and immersive. 🎵

The in-built mic is a great addition, ensuring clear communication during calls without any issues. I’ve used these earphones for both meetings and casual conversations, and the performance is flawless.

The 3.5mm audio jack offers wide compatibility, and it works perfectly with my phone, laptop, and tablet. Plus, the comfort of the earbuds is worth mentioning – they fit snugly without causing any discomfort, even during extended use.

What I love the most is how lightweight and durable these earphones are. The cable is of decent length and doesn't tangle easily, which is a huge bonus. For such a budget-friendly price, ZEBRONICS has nailed it with both quality and performance!

If you’re looking for reliable, everyday earphones that offer great sound at an affordable price, the Zeb-Bro is an excellent choice.

Whether it's about sound quality, bass or design and weight of course.

I too have boat's neckband(with prize 8-10 times more than its) and using both for long time.
The sound has a little variation in terms of bass and quality of course(what else we can expect in this price 😁₹180) but good for daily use.

The only negative side I will point out is about the quality of the product. The wire quality is not upto the mark (3/5), you have to handle it carefully and the earbuds are made of plastic material.
Also the the button in the microphone is not at all useful, sometimes it works only to stop ongoing songs but you can't increase or decrease the volume.

Overall I'll give it 4✨under the price I bought.

An important suggestion:-
If you find this product under the range of ₹200.And dont want to go for some high rate earhones, just go for it. It would be a good product to you. Otherwise, you can check out for some other earphones under 500.
Some of them are boat or MI earphones and boult audio bass earphones. 👍

Let's start with the positives. The earphones provide a snug fit, ensuring comfort even during long listening sessions. The 10mm drivers deliver satisfactory sound performance, allowing you to enjoy your favorite music and audio with clarity. The passive noise cancellation feature is an added bonus, as it helps immerse you in your audio experience by reducing external noise distractions.

Connecting the earphones to your device is a straightforward process. Simply plug in the 3.5mm audio jack, and within a few seconds, the earphones sync with your phone or tablet, ready to deliver audio.

On the downside, the build quality of the earphone cable raises concerns. Some users have reported that the wires are not as sturdy as expected, making them susceptible to damage and tangling. This weakness in the wire construction may impact the longevity of the earphones, requiring extra care and attention during use and storage.

The ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones come in a sleek design and are available in multiple color options, including Black, Blue, Green, Red, and White, allowing you to choose the one that suits your style.

In terms of technical specifications, the earphones have an impedance of 16 Ω and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable length provides adequate flexibility for comfortable usage.

It's important to note that these earphones come with a 6-month warranty, which provides some assurance in case of any manufacturing defects or malfunctions within the specified period.

In conclusion, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit, making them suitable for everyday use. However, the durability concerns surrounding the wire strength are worth considering. If you prioritize longevity and robustness in your earphone choice, you may want to explore other options. Nevertheless, if you handle them with care, these earphones can provide an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point.",2023-07-14,4,121.0,https://amazon.in/Zebronics-Zeb-Bro-Wired-Earphone/dp/B07T5DKR5D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R28ZJ801LKCB5Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5DKR5D,2025-01-12T01:01:57.005315,Positive,0.9261402487754822

Anche dopo lunghi periodi di utilizzo, quasi non si percepiscono addosso.Il suono, come tipico di JLab, è caratterizzato da bassi pronunciati, ma qui sono accompagnati da una chiarezza notevole. A differenza di altri prodotti del marchio, dove il basso può risultare confuso, qui è ben definito e piacevole.I padiglioni auricolari sono progettati in modo naturale e si adattano comodamente all'orecchio, ma il grip sulla testa non è eccezionale. Tendono a scivolare facilmente, rendendole poco adatte per l’uso in palestra o in movimento.La batteria promette fino a 70 ore di autonomia e il cavo di ricarica USB-C incluso è di buona qualità, un aspetto positivo.Un punto debole significativo è l’assenza di sensori capacitivi sui lati, che avrebbero potuto migliorare l’esperienza utente, magari con una funzione per attivare rapidamente la modalità ""Be Aware"" o Transparency.

Then ordered with Amazon Warehouse Deal the Bose QuietComfort 45, expecting Bose to be the audio connoisseur provider pur sang. Massive disappointment. Noticeable hiss of ANC and totally not HiFi sound. Switched to an Amazon Warehouse Deal Sony flagship WH-1000XM4. Painful headband, and again a hiss, and no HiFi sound. Almost gave up... And as for noise in airliners: None of these make it quiet. I end up wearing both earplugs and ANC in all of them. Choose to give JLAB a last change.

On wireless mode, I didn't find the sound quality to be as great as I expected it to be. The noice cancellation was also not exceptional. The main problem was that when I plugged in the audio cable, I found out that the right earcup of the headphone was not working at all. It was because of loose-connection (inside headphones) somewhere I guess. I decided to give it some time before I tested it once again. This time, the wireless mode sound quality dropped significantly (On sharp beats, it started producing cracking sounds). This time on wired mode, both the earcups worked fine and the sound quality was really good. After 2-3 days of usage, cracking sound is still there on wireless mode. Overall I am not satisfied with these headphones. I would recommend not investing such an amount in JBL headphones but rather to go for budget earphones.

My experience:
I am using over ear headphones after a long time, so I can say this is a little different. I wish the earcups were a little bigger. Bigger and proper insulated earpads already make the headphones somewhat noice resistance.  I have small ears, so it covers 80-90 only. For long use, my ears feel sweaty and a little bit cramped ( same as wearing winter cap over ear for long time ).
Sound :
For sound I can say, ANC is not that wonderful ( I am experiencing for first time). If u use it in room with cooler/fan, it just feels like you came 10ft away after ANC, nothing magical. Good padding can achieve that easily.
The sound quality is good, no distortion or oberbass, as a musician I can say it's somewhat balanced. The volume is little bit less, but not to be an issue.
In call I didn't recieve any complaint from the other side.
Other:
Changing device is fast. My boat 255 pro+, 330 pro+ takes some time to switch. It works fine. If i connect aux, BT turns off.
Battery is good, tried for 4-5 hours and 10% battery dropped.
Cons:
I wish the earcups were little bigger.
The mobility of earcups could be better, so that I could pack it for travel.

At first (2 days of purchasing) I was very disappointed because I felt that the sound quality was very lacking, the base and loudness disappointed me, but after a week, it started to sound very very good, I think it needed a burn period, because this headphone is now sounding very very good for me.

Build Quality - the build quality is good, no major issues, the pad is soft.

Comfort - the headphone is comfortable, but one issue is that the clamping force is a bit tight, maybe because I have a big head. Another thing is, even though this is an over read headphone it is not that big, so some part of my ear gets a bit uncomfortable after long use, but if u adjust and find the correct comfortable position, you cab wear it for a long time, I watched a 3 hr movie without any issues

Battery - omg, one of the best part of this headphone, claims 50 hr without noise cancellation, I think it lives upto the mark. You don't have to worry about battery

Sound quality - I'm not an audiophile, let me clear it up. The sound quality I felt was really good and I was very impressed, after the burn in period, so if you are buying this give it at least 1 week before judging it, trust me it really really gets better. The base was not that high, but not lacking also, was upto the mark.

Noise cancellation - it wasn't really that great, could slightly reduce the fan noise that's it, I wouldn't say it is useless, but not that bad either, could reduce the noise of tv from next room when I listened to music, so it did came in handy also with noise cancellation the sound quality I felt improved a bit.

Conclusion - as I said, I was really disappointed at first with the purchase, thought I wasted the money(6.5k) but now I'm really really enjoyed it, watching movies was the best experience with dolby music profile in my phone. I'd say it is really worth the money if ur looking for a headphone around 7k",2022-06-05,4,54.0,https://amazon.in/JBL-Cancellation-Headphones-Headphone-Assistant/dp/B096FZQ5WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1SUV63L87QD0T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096FZQ5WC,2025-01-12T01:04:06.919401,Positive,0.5177755951881409

In my experience, the JBL Tune 760NC headphones have delivered an exceptional audio experience. The sound is crystal clear with a well-balanced mix of highs, mids, and lows. The bass is robust and full-bodied, enhancing my enjoyment of a wide range of music genres.

Noise Cancellation: 4.5/5

The active noise cancellation feature of these headphones is a definite highlight. It effectively filters out ambient noise, providing an uninterrupted listening experience. However, I have noticed that it can struggle slightly with very high-frequency sounds, hence the less than perfect score.

Comfort: 4/5

The JBL Tune 760NC headphones offer a comfortable fit, thanks to a well-padded headband and soft ear cushions, making them ideal for extended listening sessions. However, as someone with a larger head, I've found the fit to be somewhat tight, which can lead to some discomfort over longer periods of use.

Volume Control: 3/5

While these headphones offer top-tier sound quality, I've had some issues with the volume control. When I adjust the volume on my device, the audio output on the headphones drops significantly. This has occasionally disrupted my listening experience, especially when I need to frequently adjust the volume.

Battery Life: 5/5

One area where the JBL Tune 760NC headphones truly excel is battery life. With up to 40 hours of playtime when the ANC is activated, these headphones have reliably lasted several days of average use without needing a recharge. This feature has made them a reliable choice for me, particularly during travel.

Design and Build: 4.5/5

I appreciate the sleek, foldable design and sturdy build of these headphones, which reflect JBL's commitment to quality. However, I've found that the control buttons, particularly for volume adjustment, could be more user-friendly.

Value for Money: 4/5

Despite the issue with volume control, I believe that the JBL Tune 760NC headphones offer good value for their price point. The superior sound quality, reliable noise cancellation, and impressive battery life make these headphones a worthwhile investment, even if they're slightly more expensive than some other models on the market.

Overall Rating: 4.3/5

In conclusion, despite a minor setback with volume control, my experience with the JBL Tune 760NC Wireless Over-Ear Active Noise-Cancelling Headphones has been largely positive. They deliver a high-quality audio experience, making them a solid choice for music enthusiasts and professionals like myself.",2024-05-28,3,3.0,https://amazon.in/JBL-Cancellation-Headphones-Headphone-Assistant/dp/B096FZQ5WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1R5X11IPTXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096FZQ5WC,2025-01-12T01:04:06.919401,Positive,0.9398667812347412
"JBL Tune 760NC, Wireless Over Ear Active Noise Cancellation Headphones with Mic, Upto 50 Hours Playtime, Multi-Device Connectivity, Pure Bass, AUX & Voice Assistant Support for Mobile Phones (Blue)",B096FZQ5WC,R14RX6RH7VK3ZZ,For a casual usage its the best option,Anshib M,"i have been using this ANC headphone for 3 months. there are many things i would like to share.

Lets break down the few factors

built quality - solid shape for both ears (normal ear size) portable and it folds so u can save space. and it wont fall from the shoulders or while putting in ears and do workouts, it stays in your head perfectly. not water resistant or proof however it is sweat proof and dust proof

Comfort- solid design for a normal ear size and cushions are soft but more than 4-5 hours without taking off use may leads to getting warm. it is basically weightless doesn't hurt head or ear its a nice design actually

ANC- its will not suppress complete surrounding sounds but ye does the job this price range, above 80% volume will turn off the anc to deliver high volume sound

sound quality- never disappoints, its JBL. when u connect using bluetooth .headphone sets around 80% of volume people do complaint about low volume in headphone. u can increase in headphone using physical buttons, however the anc will automatically turn off. the bass is great

App support- doesn't give you JBL app support but in lower models such as JBL Live 670N, JBL 500 BT and higher model such as 770NC , JBL Tune 670NC JBL Tune 770NC only has them

Connections- dual connection is supported u can connect in your lap and mobile at the same time and listen from a device one at a time. and fast pairing in smartphones is so good and u can locate device on find my device too its a good feature

charging- fast charging is supported so for 5 minutes u will get playback time about 2 hours and total charging time takes about half an hour. while charging it heats and cool down
While charging u cant use Bluetooth and the design of the headset also not meant for that
u can use aux after the headset is dead

mic- good for calls and small use it isnt that good especially in windy places (example under the fan in a room) not good for professional use

CONCLUSION
its good for all rounder headphone in this price range.  Don't listen what others says even though there are some limitations but its prefect in many aspect. perfect for photographic materiel too. after a full charge i use it for 4 days roughly. if u have budget go for it",2024-01-01,4,15.0,https://amazon.in/JBL-Cancellation-Headphones-Headphone-Assistant/dp/B096FZQ5WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R14RX6RH7VK3ZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096FZQ5WC,2025-01-12T01:04:06.919401,Positive,0.8249905705451965

Build quality- It's good for the price very good build but can break if fall or someone sits on it though build quality is great  I am using it very civil manner 😜 so mine one is absolutely fine.2. Noise cancellation- It's just a gimmick do not purchase for noise cancellation they do normal passive noise cancelation but this shouldn't be your purchasing decision for this headphone.3. Bluetooth connectivity- It works absolutely perfect for Mobile, Tab, and smart TV- But with my PC it gets little connectivity issues but that's only for 1 out of 10 times but its Okay as I used it with Aux now Because my usage is high4. Battery- It was by buying decision for this headphone I purchase it for my online classes as I need great battery life and this headphone done this job absolutely perfect I got 17-18 hours of battery on the usage at sound 70% and its great believe me big battery life is must for any Bluetooth device and it's been 10 months now it's the battery is degraded as I was heavy user now it gives around 13-15 hour. so I recommend to use it with AUX if you are going to use it for a very long period it will save your battery5. Sound quality- I purchase it for battery life and I thought sound quality will be okay and it doesn't matter to me as I will be using it for classes but I was wrong the sound quality is soo good u will find this level of sound quality in the expensive headphone for the sound quality it's 10/10.6. Now some prons that pissed me of- It got an issue only with PC while connecting I have to connect and disconnect more than 3 times. but there can be Issues with my PC also IDK because this problem only happen with PC only work fine on another device- After connecting it with AUX headphone buttons and the mic doesn't work it only works on Bluetooth mode and it totally ruins the experience with AUX u can only use it for listening with AUX, not for Video calls, normal calls, and online multiplayer game Like pubg as mic doesn't work so U have to connect it Bluetooth to unlock all these features- U can't use it in summers if u have no AC in your room U will end up with lots of sweat if You use It so consider this also because If you're going to use it in a room without AC and u are living in a city like Delhi then don't purchase it.",2021-12-07,4,54.0,https://amazon.in/boAt-Rockerz-550-Headphone-Aesthetics/dp/B08R7L77T7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3VXSMZ7Z5YFX5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08R7L77T7,2025-01-12T01:15:20.228746,Positive,0.6395928263664246

The sponge covering torn of completely after 1 year of usage and one side of the headphone broke while taking them  off my head, Really like the audio quality. One more thing I like to include is the charging port, it's built very loosely, you have to bend the whole cable and keep it tight near the port to charge.Pros: Audio quality is just awesome, u can use these headphones while listening to music ans gaming(with aux cable) too.It's is really comfortable near the ears and ear doesn't hurts after 5-6hrs of continuous usage. Battery life is also good I used to charge once in 4-6days and mostly used bluetooth.I did paired(Bluetooth only) it with my laptop and mobile at same time but headphones only process one device sound at a time so I had to mute other time to time to shift onto devices. So u have to manage this thing.It pairs with device easily without any issue or without taking much time. The aux cable is good too not too tight or too loose just perfect.Head adjustment mechanism is kinda funny because the headphones moves side to side faster when u take headphones out of adjustment idk why, could be less friction.While gaming with aux cable on u can get 0 latency(no sound delay) and can differentiate between lefts and rights and it's really helpful.I don't know the weight of headphones but they feels light on head so u can play games or watch movies without headacheCons: Build quality, full plastic body with only metal strip on head adjustment band and the plastic quality is ok ok...(cuz it broke ;-;).Charging port is loosely fitted so you have to sacrifice your cable life span.Cushion are comfy but the skin or we say covering starts to fall off after some time and the headphones looks like dog water.High latency in Bluetooth mode making it use aux cable while gaming only and if u dont have aux cable port in your device so just quit these headphones and look for something else.Looks too big on head so won't recommend for gym, walk usage.You came across whole review so here's ur cookie 🍪!",2024-10-05,3,13.0,https://amazon.in/boAt-Rockerz-550-Headphone-Aesthetics/dp/B08R7L77T7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1NDWHXCEYX5LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08R7L77T7#R1NDWHXCEYX5LG,2025-01-12T01:15:20.228746,Positive,0.7528210282325745

It doesn't cover the full ears and lies partially on top of the ear that can cause discomfort. 3/5 for form factor.

Audio is good and a bit heavy on the bass... This has now become my go to device compared to speakers... I think audio wise it's a bit lesser than Rockerz 550 but will give this a 5/5 anyway.

Audio-Technica ATH-M20x Over-Ear Professional Studio Monitor Headphones,B00HVLUR18,R3J3IU7A801PYW,"Yes, it blew my mind.",Siddharth Venkatesh,"First of all, kudos to amazon for the excellent packaging and prompt delivery.
So, I come from that group of people who never spent more than 500 bucks for a pair of headphones. I've always used the pair that came along with  my phone. I also had a Sony mdr-zx110 for sometime. You can say that this is my first real pair of high quality headphones. Here are my thoughts.

Packaging:
The box is neatly packed with some paperwork, a connector to a DAC, and the headphones themselves. No surprises there.

Build and Comfort:
I was quite surprised by how light they felt at first use. The leather cups and top padding are an absolute delight and the adjusting mechanism works like a charm. It is a bit tight initially, but gets better with use. The cable is 3m long, which can be a good or a bad thing. Personally, would have liked it to be a bit shorter. Even after listening with them for 4 hours straight, there was neither any heat build up nor was it getting uncomfortable. But it made my ears sweat more than I was expecting it to. Overall, absolute delight to use even for longer periods.

Sound quality:
I plugged it into my Moto X and listened to some Coldplay and some Indian film music. I was expecting it to blow my mind, but realised my phone was doing justice to these pair. It sounds amazing though, better than anything I have tried. But had this feeling it had more to offer. AudioFX does offer a much better listening experience when turned on.
So, I plugged it into my laptop( a HP with B&O audio) and the tables turned completely. It was unlike anything I've experienced. The sounds coming out were so natural, and so very clear. Was able to catch every note of every instrument, was finding new sounds in the tracks that I didn't know even existed. There is adequate bass and the treble is excellent. The mids are where these really shine. The vocals and instrumentals are mind-blowing. Every genre I listened to was absolutely amazing. I think these are best suited for classical, instrumental, and Jazz. I listened to some hip-hop and found the bass a bit short but nevertheless, they did sound incredible. I tried some games like COD,Battlefield and FIFA, it enhances the experience quite a lot. In FIFA, the crowd comes alive and the gunshots in COD are brilliantly reproduced.

Verdict:
If you are a casual listener who is looking for their first pair of high quality headphones, look no further. Absolutely loving every moment of using this pair. It introduced me to a whole new dimension in music. Every other headphone I use now just doesn't feel right. In short, its the best 3000 bucks I ever spent.",2016-07-10,5,7.0,https://amazon.in/Audio-Technica-ATH-M20x-Over-Ear-Professional-Headphones/dp/B00HVLUR18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3J3IU7A801PYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVLUR18,2025-01-12T01:27:36.477429,Positive,0.8450837135314941

Audio-Technica ATH-M20x Over-Ear Professional Studio Monitor Headphones,B00HVLUR18,R27P6S25TIM06C,Absolute crisp top notch sound quality.. best companion for a listener!!,Antony Joseph,"5 ⭐ for sound quality 4⭐ because of the comfort.
Writing after 6 months of usage. This is an absolute best purchase you can have on a budget(I know what you think..though I said budget but I had to save up for three months to buy this for 4.5k INR. But compared to other studio monitor headphones and the sound quality youre getting for this price is just undeniable). I sincerely disagree with every single comments out there saying this doesn't have bass. If you're an avid listener and who listen to a lot of flac then you'll understand once you listen to this. So go for it.

 Even though they said it's flat sound but I could already feel decent amount of bass without changing any eq settings. If you want true flat sound I would say sennheiser is the choice. I have used sennheiser and Sony and this would come in the middle of both when it comes to bass but the sound quality is crisp af and top notch. And yes it does work great for movies too...I haven't played games much with this apart from one or two times.. and the wire is indeed quite long as mentioned in many other reviews...it can be a plus or minus depending on your purpose..for me it's okay as I sometimes use it with full length at home and I barely took it outside. But you can coil it up and use some velcro tape which I do sometimes..initially I felt it little bit tighter which is common for every headphones and as I have a big head but that was changed as I got used to it and it loosen up little bit and now fits perfectly without any discomfort which I experienced in the first two months.

 The only two drawbacks for me so far is that..one is the cushions tends to get your ears sweaty if you live in hot n humid place like mine. But inside an air conditioned room that wouldn't be much of an issue. Second thing is the small wire that goes between the headband and speakers on both side...that I felt like a poor design choice and gives me anxiety manytimes that if I'll break it somehow.",2021-07-07,4,3.0,https://amazon.in/Audio-Technica-ATH-M20x-Over-Ear-Professional-Headphones/dp/B00HVLUR18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R27P6S25TIM06C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVLUR18,2025-01-12T01:27:36.477429,Neutral,0.4142336845397949

The sound quality is absolutely incredible – rich, deep, and crystal clear. The mic performs great, making calls smooth, and the sound isolation helps me stay focused on my studies. As a student, it's a perfect choice, especially when compared to brands like Noise or BoAt in the same price range. The premium feel of these headphones really stands out.

What really sets the Blash Max apart is the design. The 180-degree rotation ensures they stay safe from damage when not in use, unlike other headsets that can break or tilt. The soft cushions and matte finish make long online classes and study sessions comfortable. Plus, they're ideal for outdoor activities, traveling, and gym workouts – they won’t fall off like buds, which is a huge bonus. Covering the full ear, they provide a much better experience than typical on-ear headphones.

The build quality is fantastic, and the customer support team is quick and responsive if you ever need assistance. The only slight drawback is the charging time, but once charged, the call quality is premium and clear, and the music is immersive. What really impressed me is the touch controls – something you rarely find in other brands at this price.

The build quality is very good, it is made of plastic but feels sturdy and very durable. They're light & don't feel heavy on my head, and they cover my ears well. There's some passive noise cancellation here which is better than nothing. I find the headphones comfortable and can listen to music on these for hours. The sound quality is very good for this price point. It's better than the likes of boat and others in this range easily. Music is a lot of fun to listen to and there's enough bass if you're a basshead. These headphones come with the soundcore app which boasts 22 equalisers. They all sound very distinct and can enhance your listening experience. Connectivity has been very good. Once these headphones are connected to my phone I've never had issues. The battery life is truly excellent. They last around 10 days on a 80% charge and I'm a heavy user. If you're a casual they should last you 2 weeks or more easily. There are buttons on the right side for power/Play-pause and volume which you can use in case your phone is out of reach. I've never tried gaming on these so I can't comment on the latency but overall these are excellent headphones if you want to use them for music and consuming media.

The sound quality is absolutely incredible – rich, deep, and crystal clear. The mic performs great, making calls smooth, and the sound isolation helps me stay focused on my studies. As a student, it's a perfect choice, especially when compared to brands like Noise or BoAt in the same price range. The premium feel of these headphones really stands out.

What really sets the Blash Max apart is the design. The 180-degree rotation ensures they stay safe from damage when not in use, unlike other headsets that can break or tilt. The soft cushions and matte finish make long online classes and study sessions comfortable. Plus, they're ideal for outdoor activities, traveling, and gym workouts – they won’t fall off like buds, which is a huge bonus. Covering the full ear, they provide a much better experience than typical on-ear headphones.

The build quality is fantastic, and the customer support team is quick and responsive if you ever need assistance. The only slight drawback is the charging time, but once charged, the call quality is premium and clear, and the music is immersive. What really impressed me is the touch controls – something you rarely find in other brands at this price.

The sound quality is absolutely incredible – rich, deep, and crystal clear. The mic performs great, making calls smooth, and the sound isolation helps me stay focused on my studies. As a student, it's a perfect choice, especially when compared to brands like Noise or BoAt in the same price range. The premium feel of these headphones really stands out.

What really sets the Blash Max apart is the design. The 180-degree rotation ensures they stay safe from damage when not in use, unlike other headsets that can break or tilt. The soft cushions and matte finish make long online classes and study sessions comfortable. Plus, they're ideal for outdoor activities, traveling, and gym workouts – they won’t fall off like buds, which is a huge bonus. Covering the full ear, they provide a much better experience than typical on-ear headphones.

The build quality is fantastic, and the customer support team is quick and responsive if you ever need assistance. The only slight drawback is the charging time, but once charged, the call quality is premium and clear, and the music is immersive. What really impressed me is the touch controls – something you rarely find in other brands at this price.

Skullcandy Hesh ANC Bluetooth Wireless Over-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black),B08G1ZBKGP,R2U7C09BJ6PM7O,Mixed feelings about the build. Sound is Awesome!,Sangeetha Sivanandam,"I've been using the product for past five days. Will write more in depth review later.

Sound quality:
Pretty decent. As a person who likes neutral sound signature, hearing this amount of bass is pleasant. It will rattle your head with ANC TURNED OFF. With ANC TURNED ON, bass is lil less but it didn't bottom out. More like natural sounding one.  People with sensitive ear SHOULD GIVE THIS A CHANCE. Ambient mode is amazing and really useful when you want to be aware of your surroundings.
Packaging:
You don't get old cushiony pouch recently. Just a cloth bag with strings with Skullcandy logo on it.
You will get 2 inch charging cable C-type cable. We all have long C type cable for phones. So, this will not be an issue for the people already have the cables.
Packaging is indeed different from the release years. Skullcandy is always changing the packaging. Currently it looks similar to hesh evos.

What I disliked so far is that the extention slider in the headband is loose right out of the box. It slides easily. No tension at all. I don't know whether SKULLCANDY intentionally made it that way or defective one. I've used headphones before. They usually slide off this much only after the use of a few good months.",2023-06-03,4,9.0,https://amazon.in/Skullcandy-Cancellation-Wireless-Headphone-Technology/dp/B08G1ZBKGP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2U7C09BJ6PM7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G1ZBKGP,2025-01-12T01:44:04.954585,Positive,0.8071916103363037
Skullcandy Hesh ANC Bluetooth Wireless Over-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black),B08G1ZBKGP,R2TKOENOK29VGQ,Audiophile quality at a sensible price!!,vivek,"Amazing product at a great price! First, the audio quality- uniquely detailed. Every instrument, voice, chorus and Synth effect can be clearly and individually discerned. It is nicely bass-oriented, which adds great depth to an already elaborate soundstage. Even then, if you want to reduce bass, use the Dolby Atmos Equalizer on your Android phone to tailor the sound exactly to your taste. Hence, the absence of app-controlled Equalizer is not missed at all. Clamping force is noticeable in the first few days but reduces thereafter. ANC is very good for day to day use with a slight chop-off at the base end, but that is anyway not noticeable in a noisy environment. The transparent mode is a BIG PLUS and you will use it much more than you expect. The light weight and great padding really helps, since long hours are guaranteed with this pair on. Buttons are sturdy and a bit hard to press, but the layout is intuitive and easy to adapt to. Sound quality over Bluetooth is actually better than that over the cable, which is mildly surprising. Battery life is very decent. You'll certainly need to buy a hardened carrying case, though, of you don't want to damage the equipment while travelling. Super thrilled with this product!!!",2023-08-06,5,13.0,https://amazon.in/Skullcandy-Cancellation-Wireless-Headphone-Technology/dp/B08G1ZBKGP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2TKOENOK29VGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G1ZBKGP,2025-01-12T01:44:04.954585,Positive,0.9222882390022278
Skullcandy Hesh ANC Bluetooth Wireless Over-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black),B08G1ZBKGP,R2LTL0A4ZZT4QW,Great sound and ANC but pathetic build quality! Won't stand the test of time!,Koustub Poddar,"Physical overview:
1. Headphones made out of plastic. Really good build quality. Earcups have soft touch plastic on the outside.
2. Earcups have memory foam, which makes them more comfortable to use overtime.
3. Headband has sufficient padding as well.
4. Outside each earcup, there are two microphones (total 4) that are meant to pickup outside noise and cancel it out by supplying equal amounts of anti noise. The right earcup sports an additional microphone for calls, and does a terrific job in this regard. This microphone array/setup is identical to Sony's flagship over the ear/circumaural ANC headphones, the Sony WH-1000 XM4.
5. It sports a built in Tile™ tracker as well.
6. It features a collapsible design for enhanced portability.
7. The right earcup features the control set as well.
8. The headbands extend to a comfortably large size. They extend from the upper joints.

Package contents:
Headphones, 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable, USB C to USB A charging cable, headphones carrying pouch, user manual and warranty card.

Pros:
1. Great sound signature, just like the Hesh 3 wireless.
2. Very comfortable to use over long periods of time.
3. Fantastic ANC at this price. Obviously it's not as dope as Sony WH-1000 XM4 or Bose NC700, but the difference isn't huge, it's noticeable but not huge. Do note that no matter what ANC headphones you buy, at whatever price, it won't block out everything around you, that's the reason why some people set unrealistic expectations with regards to ANC performance, and get disappointed when the product doesn't meet their expectations.
4. Battery life is amazing, as claimed by Skullcandy.
5. Robust build quality, with collapsible design.

Cons:
1. No multipoint connection.
2. No hard case provided.
3. Skullcandy app doesn't support this, so you won't get personal sound on this one.

Conclusion:
Just go for it if you're looking for high quality ANC headphones at not so high price. 5 stars!

P.S.- It's Made in China.

Update 1: As of 22 July 2024, almost 3 years since its purchase, despite handling with utmost care (you can see the condition of headband and earcups) these earcups fell off on their own. Reducing their rating to 1 star. Pathetic build quality for ₹11K.
Don't go for it unless it retails for less than ₹6K (reason I am still recommending it is because of its ANC and Audio Quality, spare earcups are also available here on Amazon, so your headphones won't become useless if they happen to fall out or wear out over time. I've ordered them too, let's see how things turn out).

Update 2: So, my replacement earcups just arrived and they happen to fit my Hesh ANC pretty well.

Skullcandy Hesh ANC Bluetooth Wireless Over-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black),B08G1ZBKGP,R2GW6WBR06OXXU,It’s mid.,kelengol zao,"Sliders (one side) are loose from the box itself, whenever you change from ambient to noise cancelling on or off, it stops audio to narrate the mode.
Apart from that everything else is okay.
Build quality is Okay.
Audio quality is pretty good, tho there’s a change when you switch modes, you can hear the drastic decrease in bass when you switch on noise cancellation
Aesthetic is fine. It’s does seem a little smaller than the pictures online but fits comfortably
Cushions feel good- soft and doesn’t hurt the ears
The narrater when you switch it on or switch modes is unappealing (opinion) I liked the simpler sesh anc’s where they reduced the volume for a smooth transition
The buttons are placed below the head set and are cramped, rubber material
It’s a decent one, I did have expectations of it but at this range I wouldn’t have picked this if I tried it out first
Overall, sound, comfort, aesthetic, charging, is good
But value for money, the abrupt silence from switching modes, no eq and the loose sliders are a no
I got it cuz I like the brand, but do try them out before you purchase one because it’s all personal preference at the end :)",2024-12-28,3,,https://amazon.in/Skullcandy-Cancellation-Wireless-Headphone-Technology/dp/B08G1ZBKGP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2GW6WBR06OXXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08G1ZBKGP,2025-01-12T01:44:04.954585,Positive,0.8605328798294067

ANC is very good for a 11K headphone comparable to the premium ones. Bass is punchy and strong and goes deep. Buttons are easy to use and very intuitive and these have over 22 hours of battery with ANC which is cool to see at this price point. Comes with Tile embedded which will be very useful if you lose your headphones. Build quality is very decent with soft touch plastic and metal headband. I think these will last a long time.

"ZEBRONICS Duke Wireless Headphone with Up to 60h Backup, Supports Bluetooth, Dual Pairing, Gaming Mode, Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC), LED Lights, Deep Bass, Voice Assistant Support (Blue)",B088FLHXJX,R3F94R6AM0IOKO,(⁠ﾉ⁠*⁠0⁠*⁠)⁠ﾉ FREAKINN AMAZINNNNNNG ! Most definitely go for it (⁠｡⁠♡⁠‿⁠♡⁠｡⁠),Aman Anand,"Before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-
1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence I was concerned.
2. Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.
3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .
4.Sturdiness and Build quality.
5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.
6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.

Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.

1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.
2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.
3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones. Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .
4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).
5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.
6. With Bluetooth , its justt Awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. Though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠Ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ I Like It (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode. Can keep using it even if the battery is dead. I Like this feature so much. For a student like me , its a charmer. No unnecessary breaks . And With the full sound ☠️ You won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ Its that awesome.  Sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. I mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. It is crazyyyy . You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.

It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones. But I have used Boat Rockerz which my friend has , And I can say without a doubt , Giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.The comfort , the looks , the loudness , the RGB (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). I even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.
I'm so glad I bought this as my first headphones. I was very skeptical but now that I'm using it 😍 , Its just a wonderful experience.

Most negative comments I believe are one in hundred Instances or anomaly or exceptions. Most people DON'T review a product till it's defective. Only very few people review when the product it perfect.
This is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.
Don't worry bout anything , just go for it. Luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. Its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. Anyway. Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.",2023-06-08,5,507.0,https://amazon.in/Zebronics-Bluetooth-Headphone-Assistant-Multifunction/dp/B088FLHXJX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3F94R6AM0IOKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_img?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B088FLHXJX,2025-01-12T01:45:38.050005,Negative,0.5687764883041382

The product is very good, I didn't yet test the microphone because its just been 2 days, I can hear everything very good. Charger and AUX wire is also given at very proper length. The length adjustment of the headphones is also okay. Very looong battery. Soft ear cushions. It take very long to off the headphones but its okay.
I gave it 4 stars only because, sometimes while listening to music, I hear some kind of noise, not from my surroundings but from the headphones.

And I can say at the prize point that this headphones available is really really good.
Headphones come with the 40 mm drivers which actually helps to create a mesmerizing sound but the problem is sometimes the bass is very over powering so sometimes you are not able to hear the medis & vocals clearly. They are loud and battery backup in this headphone is really good.
The day this headphone arrived it was on 100% charging and i have used the headphone for 6 days and after that it discharged.

Fit of the headphones are good sturdy.

"ZEBRONICS Duke Wireless Headphone with Up to 60h Backup, Supports Bluetooth, Dual Pairing, Gaming Mode, Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC), LED Lights, Deep Bass, Voice Assistant Support (Blue)",B088FLHXJX,R2VI7EOD6M3Q6U,A good choice with some sacrifices,Suraj P,"3.5/5

I have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.

Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.

PROS:
- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted
- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape
- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer
- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.

CONS:
- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said
- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while
- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.
- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it. Only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. This means I always have to carry an additional wire in my backpack

Overall decent pair. In my previous (edited now) review, I mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. After several days I realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. So, I have edited my review and updated the rating

The reviews are very polarising (either good or bad) and to my surprise neither were truly wrong. So i was skeptical but i found it on sale for 999 so i just bought it.. I will do a pros and cons first and a super detailed review after it (the review will be given keeping the price range of 1500-2000 in mind)
Pros:
- Build Quality
- Sound Quality (after EQ) [Amazing Bass, crystal clear and lively vocals with ear-fatigue free & nice treble tones]
- Battery Life
- Dual Connectivity and stable connection
- No noticeable latency in videos
- Comfort
- Sick RGB

Cons:
- Mic Quality
-Sound Quality (without EQ) [Amazing Bass, Bad vocals, Bad treble tones]
-Low battery indications every 60 secs after 20% (didn't say 1 min as people might take it as an exaggeration)
- You cant change or keep 1 colour on rgb, it changes on its own
- Few Service Centres
- Sometimes the headphones goes into a weird state where you have to keep the power button pressed for 10-30 seconds for it to work again

Minor cons (which are completely fine for the price but are worth mentioning)
-the rgb also turns on each time you power on the headphone so turning it off for more battery gets a bit annoying
-The earcups dont fold (if you want to keep them on your neck then you will have to extend them , after that they wont restrict your head movement)
-Each time you start/turn off the headphones or it connects/disconnects there is a voice announcement which i found to be quite annoying

DETAILED REVIEW

1) Build Quality: The headband is made of made up of metal and looks very sturdy. The plastic used on the earcups is also of a good quality and i don't think it will break easily. The wire that is visible is thick and i aint worried about it. The earcups dont fold (which i knew) but it could have been a good addition.  The cushioning on the headband is minimal but soft so you wont have a problem there. The ear cushions are very soft. Dimensions of entire ear cushion 10cm x 8cm . Dimensions of the opening for our ears 5.6cm x 4cm.The buttons wobble a little bit in their place but are clicky & tactile. The box it comes in, is very Sturdy and can be used to keep the headphone.

2) Looks: The headphone has a sick matte black colour which i love, the side profile looks amazing, it does look a bit bulky and weird when you look at it from the front though.

3) Comfort:  I thought the hole should be as big as my ear to be comfortable which was not the case, my ear is like 6 cm and it still fits inside (with unnoticeable bending as the hole does get a bit bigger inside due to the pressure of our earlobes against it). The headphone does not feel heavy at all. The clamping force is just enough to keep the headphone from slipping, it isn't much which increases the comfort. The earcup wobbles a bit for a comfortable angle on your head. The clicks to increase or decrease the size are tight so the size wont change when you shake your head. I didn't have any discomfort wearing it for 4-5 hours straight. Although, the ears do sweat after 2-3 hours in normal temperature so you have to take a break of 2 mins (it doesnt feel warm but the sweat can speed up the wear and tear of the ear cushions. the way i do it is to just let out the air inside the headphones every once in like 30 mins for 15 secs which is much more efficient)

Note: If its your first time wearing an over ear headphone then it might take a couple of days to get used to the weight and clamping force. Also, like all over ear headphones, they will be tight out of the box but they will loosen up after several hours of use (you can just put it on a pillow in between the earcushions instead if your head overnight)

4) Battery Life: I think it goes upto 20-22 hours on higher volumes (can be used only till 20% is left, after that unusable due to voice alerts)

5) Charging Time: Takes about 1hr 45 mins to go from 20% to 100%

6) Connectivity: I tried going into another room and it worked just fine so don't worry about the range. This headphone has dual connectivity which isn't mentioned anywhere, you can connect with 2 devices and if you play something with 1 device, the other pauses and vice versa

7) Latency: There is no noticeable latency in most videos or movies (there is a very slight delay which you can notice if you try noticing it hard but you wont do that while watching anything so its safe to say there is no noticeable latency, the latency can also be noticed if the person talks really fast)

8) Gaming: When you do gaming via bluetooth you will notice the latency like pretty much every wireless product without a gaming mode of 80ms latency. You can make out where the sound is coming from pretty easily. You can use the aux to get 0 latency.

9) Mic: The mic is straight up bad, lacks both clarity and loudness (Do note that the mic won't work with the aux cable)

10) Sound Isolation: You can't really hear anything of outside if something is playing in your headphones. If the volume is loud the people around you can hear it which is a con, other headphones do a better job here

11) Sound Quality (without EQ): The bass is very powerful, perfect for bass lovers but the mids and highs aren't even good

12) Sound Quality (with basic EQ):The Sound is loud enough at 100% for pretty much anyone who does not have significant hearing loss. The bass can be made less powerful or even more powerful if you want to blast your skull with the bass. The mids are produced very nicely. The highs are on point (neither sharp nor dull, its sparky enough without causing ear fatigue). The clarity is also very nice, the sounds seems crystal clear and crispy The distortion is very less.
(Note: My Basic EQ is just take the little dots in the right half and increase all of them to some extent, keep the leftmost dot where it was and try to make a straight line between the leftmost and middle dots with the other dots left in the left half). One thing to note is that, you will find that the headphone skipped a word, its random and not that often but its worth mentioning

13) Sound quality via aux: The same things apply here but the max volume is 90% of what it was via bluetooth and the clarity gets a boost if you play FLAC format music

1 Year Edit for Durability: Everything still stands true, the earcup vinyl (i think that is the material) started
coming off suddenly after 10 months i think and now its gone but it doesnt make a difference to sound or comfort. It randomly stopped working, i think the power button disconnected so i sent them via courier to the service centre (in warranty) and they sent it back in a week i think. I dropped them twice from 3 feet and it stayed fine, but someone sat on my headphones and one side got de-attached from the headband held on just by wire, it then dropped twice after that and that one side stopped working. I tried contacting service centres about how much the repair will cost so that i dont end up spending 400 or something to get this headphone repaired when i bought it for 999 but they didnt respond so i can spend either 100 to get this to the service centre by courier (most companies have a pick up service like soundcore) or go 20km away to get it repaired myself (which is hard during covid).

Connectivity- it's pretty simple to connect and the Bluetooth 5.3 makes it far better and it's connection range is also pretty good
Quality - the quality of the overall headphones and packaging was good
It's foam and steady cushion top makes it better to lean on and work for a long time
Durability is also pretty good I'd say but I am not very sure as I've not used it for a long time
Call quality - it was pretty good and the other person also reported as a normal voice they were hearing
Features the main highlight

ANC - ITS not very good but I also don't have any experience about how anc should feel but according to my experience it isn't very good nor bad it just gets the work done
The music mode is pretty good I listened to about 15-17 songs and they were all in the best figure I loved this audio part
The gaming mode gives a delay of 0.3 seconds whilst the music gives about 1 sec so now you guys decide
The audio quality is fire 🔥
Also if you use the aux cable that is the best thing you can do because it provides with an astonishing bass and an unbelievable sound quality and I was actually amazed by how it turned out
Lastly the battery is as they promised I've been using it for about 4 hours now after giving it a full charge and it's still 100% so it's pretty amazing
Problems -------
1.The earcuffs are a little small so they could pose some problems
2. It is actually a little heavy and causes headaches after use for a long time
3. Nothing man it's just perfect

So my final rating is 4.5*/5*
It's upto you but it's best for daily usage and study purposes
And I'm rating it on the basis of the price I bought that was 1299/- and it's pretty durable and easy to use in this range i appreciate this on

UI:
Power On. Hold the center button for 2 seconds and the earphones with say in a Japanese/Indian woman's voice, ""power On, battery about 70%"". She does not sound Chinese like the cheap Chinese headphones. Her voice volume level is not very high either.

BT pairing:
Turn off the headset, press and hold to center button but keep holding the same button. The headsets voice will say, Bluetooth pairing"". Once connected, it will say, ""Bluetooth connected"". If BT disconnects, the voice says, ""Bluetooth disconnected"".

Next track:
Press and hold the + button for 2 seconds and the headset will make a cute ""chime"" and load the next song in the playlist of any app. I like this feature of the chime because this way I know the headset has accepted the command and loading the next track. However, holding the button for 2 second everytime you want to change songs can get annoying and painful if you want to skip a couple of songs of just skipping endlessly waiting for the right song to play. Buttons aren't very soft but do have a tactile click to ensure you feel the click when pressed.

Power off: just like power on, hold the center button for 2 seconds and the headset will turn off.

Volume up/down: No audible feedback, just volume increase or decrease.

Status LED:
Blue: when On and slow blinking when connected to bt. When in pairing mode, the same light blinks quickly in the same blue colour.

Orange: while charging. Solid on.
Green/off: 90% and above.

Physical clues: tiny nub on the left ear plug to denote left side. Only reputed brands have it.
Same tiny bump is made in the volume up button on the controller to denote volume +.
Coloured Dots on the plastic controller to denotr left and right channel.
Ear plugs are colour coded and fit very well in my ears. Most of the ear plugs fall out of my ears while talking. These don't. I use the smallest one.

What does Sony offer?
A very neat guide on how to insert the ear plugs in your ears the most comfortable way and ensure the best seal for clear audio. I've never known that you can pull you ear up from the top corner and gently place the ear plug into your ear canal. Once placed comfortably, drop the ear and let the ear canal seal in.

Audio App. It's basically a music player designed to detect the sony earphones. If you use spotify you can use this app to setup an equaliser. It plays MP3 from your storage too. My phone already has a built in Equalizer. I don't use any eq because the sound stage on these is flat. So all types of audio sounds great.

FAQ
Is it flimsy?
No, but feels like you might damage it if you're not careful.

Does it really last 25hr?
Yes, I've tested it sort of. And never managed to run out of battery.

How much did you spend on it?
1.6k

Audio lag?
None. I tested it with Android TV, LG web os, Android phone, ps4 and iPad. No issues of lag or disconnection or audio drop on super quiet moments of the song.

Bass?
Very decent and controlled.
Vocals?
Very clear
Treble?
Sharp and crisp.
Loudness?
You can listen at full volume without much discomfort. But I'd suggest not to.

I compared it with JBL wave tws100. The sound is very similar but a we bit less bass on flat eq.

Very average. You will have to use Equalizer to suit to your listening habit.

But it is what actually I want, according to sound it lacks volume but soundstage is good, trebles work perfectly, vocals are clear, bass is soothing and deep. I like the integration of application which tells me my listening hours and set an equalizer according to my preference. I don't know much about DSEE upscaling but it makes a difference, listening to these earphones feels like listening to wired earphones with no lag and weird sound upscaling which other TWS does. Build quality will be a concern for rough users but not for me, it is pretty good for me. The neck part is not stiff which makes it easy to carry. I am a designer, According to a designer's perspective I would it has attention to details like the left and right are separated even with a color difference. Although, I didn't like the long press to change controls system and its not customizable. These earphones are waterproof and have sufficient battery life to support through my busy weeks. Also we can change the language of the instructor of earphones, I chose Japanese because I am a big fan of anime. Also the buds are non magnetic, but it dosen't creates much problem.

I earlier used Oppo Enco M32 which was very good with right amount of bass and good music separation and clarity. But one of its side stopped working after an year. Oppo didn't launch it's successor and M32 was also not available for sale. So with no other option I had to buy the OnePlus Z2 ANC. It's earfit wasn't good for me unlike Oppo Enco M32. It was uncomfortable in the ear wearing the Z2 ANC. Also the sound output wasn't good compared to Oppo Enco M32.
OnePlus Z2 ANC had too much bass. It's music clarity and separation weren't good compared to my previous Oppo Enco M32.

Now coming to this Sony neckband, though it's build quality isn't as good as Oppo or OnePlus, its build serves the purpose and it's sound output is superior than every bluetooth neckband in India right now.
This Sony neckband is much better than my previous OnePlus Z2 ANC in sound clarity, music separation, sharp sounds and right amount of bass. Music clarity is also slightly better than my Oppo Enco M32.

Also the ear fit is good, light weight and comfortable to wear than OnePlus Z2 ANC. The mics are good for phone calls too. Design is basic but functional.
The EQs work very well and the differences can be evidently felt.
The Sony app is also good and serves the purpose very well.

This is the best bluetooth neckband right now when it comes to music clarity and separation.
Definitely buy it if you are a listener preferring sound quality and not too much bass.
You won't be disappointed with this Sony neckband.

But, if you are a heavy bass lover, then this neckband isn't for you.

The boat rockerz and mi dual drivers are bloated with Bass as well as, sub bass. with almost the same price as this neckband, the KZs are bright with more bass than sub bass. But its a wired chi-fi with huge sound stage, resolution and superb Clarity that cannot be compared to any of my other earphones.
Now, lets talk about the sony wi c100.
The sound stage is average, resolution is low(it plays only AAC quality sound).
As sony says they are well balanced. but from someone who has the KZs, I felt the treble not lacking, but artificial. the same goes for they vocal clarity, but as this neckband is more focused on voice calls.... its really really good.
The sound quality recorded in the mic is just phenomenal, the best of any other earphones i have.
So the treble is average, mids are pretty damm good and last but nor the least, the Bass and Sub Bass ....IS Beautiful!! Natural, Smooth and way better than the boat rockerz. not too much not too less. just the right amount of the sub bass and bass. though i thought it was a little bit extra, I turned it 1 level down from the sony headphones app.
Oh and if you buy these. do not use your inbuilt equaliser. it doesn't work as expected on these. instead, download the sony headphones app. it has a independent bass tuner to turn the bass and sub bass(together) low and high, naturally.
I think the Price could have been some 200-300 rs low. but remember, sony is a popular and trusted headphone brand. also after keep in my that the sound quality is excellent, even though its Bluetooth.
I used these for two days. they are very light weight. the build for the ear part is small, weird and it little bit hard to fit in. but I didn't fell any irritation. Overall Built quality doesn't look promising. but i trust sony and think they'll last 3 years atleast.

Pros:
1. Impressive Sound Quality: The bass performance is exceptional, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience. Whether I’m listening to music or watching videos, the sound quality is clear and powerful.
2. Stylish Design: The Furious Red color gives these earphones a bold and attractive look. They stand out, and I appreciate the sleek design that complements my style.
3. Comfortable Fit: The in-ear design comes with multiple ear tips, allowing me to find the perfect fit. They stay securely in place, even during workouts or long listening sessions.
4. Built-in Microphone: The mic works well for phone calls and voice commands. The sound quality during calls is clear, making conversations easy and hassle-free.
5. Tangle-Free Cable: The cable is made from a durable material that resists tangling, which is a huge plus for me. It makes storage and transport much more convenient.
6. Affordable Price: Given their performance and quality, these earphones are very reasonably priced. They offer great value compared to many other brands in the market.

Cons:
1. Limited Noise Isolation: While the earphones provide decent passive noise isolation, they may not completely block out external sounds in noisy environments. Users seeking a more immersive experience might want to consider noise-canceling options.
2. Cable Durability: Although the cable is tangle-free, it might be prone to wear and tear with heavy usage. Care should be taken to avoid pulling or bending it excessively.
3. Sound Signature: The bass-heavy sound signature may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those who prefer a more balanced sound profile. It might overpower mids and highs in certain music genres.
4. No Inline Controls: While the microphone is handy for calls, there are no inline controls for volume or playback, which can be inconvenient for some users.

Overall:
The boAt Bassheads 100 in Ear Wired Earphones (Furious Red) are an excellent choice for anyone seeking quality sound and comfort at an affordable price. With impressive bass, a stylish design, and a comfortable fit, they’re perfect for daily use.

"Sennheiser Accentum Plus Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones-Designed in Germany with Quick-Charge,50H Battery(with ANC),Adaptive Hybrid ANC,Sound Personalization and 2 Yr Warranty Â– White",B0CQKFTYW5,R1HY2QXN55IOBU,Accentum Plus Wireless,Amaan siddiqui,"Pros:

Seamless Bluetooth Connection: Let me tell you, the Bluetooth 5.2 on the Sennheiser Accentum Plus is a game-changer. Even Sony XM4 which is like 5k more expense has BT 5.0 so this is a no brainer.

Immersive Noise Cancellation: The Adaptive ANC on these headphones is next-level. It adapts to wherever I am, drowning out distractions and letting me get lost in my music like never before.

Impressive Battery Life: I'm blown away by how long the battery lasts. I used to constantly worry about my Sony XM4 dying on me, but with the Accentum Plus, I can enjoy my tunes all day long without needing a recharge.

Quick Charging: One thing I really appreciate is the quick charge feature. It's a lifesaver when I'm in a rush – just a short charge and I'm good to go for hours.

Unbeatable Sound Quality: Sure, the Sony XM4 had great noise cancellation, but the sound quality on the Accentum Plus is on another level. From crisp highs to deep bass, every note is crystal clear and immersive.

Cons:

App Registration Hassle: The only downside is having to register on the app for customized sound settings. It's a bit of a pain, but once it's done, the personalized sound experience is totally worth it.
Overall, the Sennheiser Accentum Plus Wireless Headphones have truly impressed me. They're a must-have for anyone who wants top-notch sound quality, reliable connectivity, and long-lasting battery life.",2024-03-28,5,2.0,https://amazon.in/Sennheiser-Accentum-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B0CQKFTYW5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1HY2QXN55IOBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQKFTYW5#R1HY2QXN55IOBU,2025-01-12T01:48:54.932675,Positive,0.8751639127731323

It is direct competitor of Sony ULT WEAR. But Utl wear is predecessor of Sony WH-XB910N, it was known for extreme bass. Extreme! yes, it will actually start dancing on your head.
My vision was clear, I had been searching for an over the ear headphones for multi-purpose use. (Music, office-meeting, YouTube-content watch/listening on PC and Phone).
Don't like:
1. Sennheiser smart control is really bad. Bass-booster is just useless. Don't fall for this marketing gimmick. Tips: Don't believe YouTube review videos blindly. All are doing business. I read some reviews from the internet. Even some Reddit users told the truth about this headphone.
2. I couldn't turn off touch control of this headphone.
3. I couldn't find any way to control Equalizer from PC. (Will talk about the Dolby Access in What I liked part)
Do Like:
1. Design
2. Cushions are totally air locked. On transparency mode you will start listening to extra sound.
3. my use case: 70% time I use it with PC, in this area it is just performing like a charm.
4. With Dolby Access (paid version. Cost 1000-1200 INR for lifetime), enhanced the power of this headphone by 300% (yes, 3 times compared to mobile), shared screenshot, with only 18% sound this performance is equivalent to 60% of mobile devices.
5. Dolby Atmos on Phone: With this application other headphone were failed to perform well. But Sennheiser Accentum Plus has the ability.
6. When you have Dolby Atmos on phone, and Dolby access on PC, you only need good balanced headphone. Here Sennheiser Accentum Plus stand out.
If our devices are failed to produce good sound, then we cannot blame the headphone only!

conclusion: If you like to hear good music, not super bassy song, then simply go for it. Low-mid-high, in every area it is just Awesome.
for ANC part, you can believe the youtubers, ANC works fine under flat/continuous incoming sound (under 80-90 Db).
point to note: Produce 3 times extra sound with type c port.
In single stretch I can easily use it for long 3 hours, no headache, no pain behind the ear, no overhead pain I felt.

"Sennheiser Accentum Plus Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones-Designed in Germany with Quick-Charge,50H Battery(with ANC),Adaptive Hybrid ANC,Sound Personalization and 2 Yr Warranty Â– White",B0CQKFTYW5,R264HA33CMOFBT,Decent product,Dipayan Roy,"Describing this product after using for few days a little difficult but I'm trying to cover up all the pros and cons that I have felt after using it for long hours. First coming to the pros:

PROS:
1. It's design & comfort: It has a very unique design, the company has done very good R&D for this product in order to provide maximum comfort. It is comfortable enough to wear and use it for long time, You ears will not be getting warmed. Also, you should not feel any pain if you use it while wearing spec(like me). Also the design and looks can give you feel that it is a heavy headphone but it is actually very light weighed, plus the ear cushions are very comfortable. So 5 * for its design and comfort.
2. Connectivity: It is claimed to be very compatible with iPhone and iPad and works with android. Well it connects seamlessly with my iPhone, but in case of android phone I tried to connect, the phone bluetooth was not able to search this headphone. So, I have doubt upon the android connectivity. It comes with a 3.5mm cable jack which makes it easier to use with both my MacBook and Windows laptop. So connectivity wise I'll provide 4 * . 1* less, since I'm not able to connect to android. So if you are planning to buy it for your android device, I'd not recommend this product.
3. Audio Quality: It has decent bass, good quality audio. You can easily distinguish between the vocals and the each different musical tones. It is good to use in between 80-90% of volume levels since the audio output is not that much high. Overall I'd give the audio quality a 4 * rating.
4. Active Noise Cancellation: It works decently in terms of ANC, almost 80% outside noise gets nullified. So I'd give 4 * rating in terms of ANC.
5. Call Quality: Call quality is very crisp and clear, no noise interference as well as microphone works smoothly. I tried with phone call/ FaceTime/ Teams, and in all aspects the call experience was superb. So 5 * rating for call quality.
6. Battery: The USP for this headphone is its battery backup. Company claims 50 hours of battery backup. The piece I received, initially had 70% battery. Since then I'm using it for almost 40 hours with ANC on always, still I can see 20% battery is remaining. So definitely I'm gonna give 5 * rating for that.

CONS:
1. Touch functionalities: I'm disappointed with this feature, since it is a premium headphones but its touch functionalities are not upto the mark (especially the volume controls). This headphone lags very much in this feature since the touch response are not consistent enough. I'll give 2 * rating for this feature.
2. Smart Control app: The app needs improvement and needs to be more user friendly. Sometimes during the initial pairing you may face troubles. But once connected, it works smoothly. Still there are lot of scope of improvement. So rating for the app I'd give 3 *.
3. Prices: I've bought it for 15,990/- which I felt a little bit higher. It could be anywhere between 12000-13000, actually based upon the performance and considering pros and cons I felt this price range should be ideal. Probably during Great Indian Festival time, you can get this product within 13k which could be a great deal.
So, my overall rating for this product is 4 * and since it solves all my purposes I'm going to use it for long times. If I come up with any of issue after long time usage, I'll add the same in this review.

Update: For the Connectivity point under PROS, earlier I mentioned I was facing issue while pairing with android device. But now I’m able to connect to android as well as windows laptops seamlessly via bluetooth. So I would like to change the Connectivity rating from 4 * to 5 *. Therefore, people who are willing to buy it for android or windows devices can easily go for it.",2024-04-12,4,30.0,https://amazon.in/Sennheiser-Accentum-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B0CQKFTYW5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R264HA33CMOFBT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQKFTYW5,2025-01-12T01:48:54.932675,Positive,0.7986773252487183

  Super Extra Bass: These headphones are designed to deliver enhanced bass response, making them ideal for bass enthusiasts who enjoy genres like hip-hop, EDM, and rock.

Cons:

  Wired Connection: As wired headphones, they may restrict movement compared to wireless options, which might be inconvenient for active users.
  Average Noise Isolation: While the in-ear design provides some noise isolation, it may not fully block out external sounds, especially in noisy environments.
  Durability Concerns: Some users may find that the build quality is decent but may not be as robust as higher-end models, potentially leading to wear over time.

boAt Bassheads 225 Wired in Ear Earphone with Mic (Red),B01MCUSD3L,RYJDE3KJM5VS6,boAt BassHeads 225: Unmatched Bass with Improved Durability,Naveen P Nair,"I have been a fan of the boAt BassHeads 225 since I first used the older model back in 2018. Recently, I decided to purchase this model again, primarily for its unmatched sound quality, broad device compatibility, and impressive bass performance. The signature boAt sound, especially the deep, punchy bass, remains the standout feature that keeps me loyal to this product as a hardcore bass enthusiast.

While I noticed that the build quality of the earbuds themselves has shifted from metal to plastic, the overall improvements in design make up for it. The new L-shaped jack features a more ergonomic, compact angle, and the reinforced joints have been significantly upgraded, addressing durability concerns from the older model. My previous pair worked well until joint weakness near the jack led to its eventual failure, a problem that now seems to be resolved.

Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.

Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.
But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.
I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.
Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.
Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.
But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.
I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.
In short I am the king of bad luck in this.
Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.
Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.
I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.
But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.
Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man
But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.
And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.
But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.
Ahh the moment let me share with you guys  she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.
We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.
But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.
Whole night I will awake and very stressed.
Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.
She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.
She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.
But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.
She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.
I know her past she was love in some man.
Who is more than  double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.
Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.
Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life  I am very good predictor.
May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.
My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.
I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.
Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.
I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.

 Boat BassHeads 225 have a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
 It Features 10 mm drivers.
 Rated Impedance of 16 ohms.

 Sensitivity : 98 dB+/-3 dB.

____________________
Built Quality & Design
---------------------------------

I was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise, Boat BassHeads 225 are fully made up of metal. It has a diagonal grid-like texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch. The metal construction gives Boat BassHeads 225 a premium feel & attractive appearance. The cable used by Boat on BassHeads 225 is Flat with rubberized coating, it is a tangle-free cable & does it's job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling. Despite the metal construction, Boat BassHeads 225 are very lightweight & comes with a microphone & L-Shaped 3.5 mm audio jack which is again made up of metal. Overall the built quality is excellent for the price & seems very durable. The ear buds have proper L & R labels and are clearly visible. Boat BassHeads 225 comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed out-of-the-box.

___________
Audio Quality
-------------------

To ensure that I can test the BassHeads 225 at their uppermost limit, I used high-quality MP3 files of 320 kbps & Lossless audio formats like FLAC & WAV. For smartphone listening, I used Poweramp music player & tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability. For the computer, I used iTunes player & VLC Audio player. I also tested these earphones on Apple iPod, iPhone & Sony MP3 Player. All this went for more than 10 days & finally, I had my results.

Boat BassHeads 225 promised what they claimed, they really are very bassy as compared to others. During my tests with them, I found that the audio quality is very good for the price, the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default, by tweaking the equalizer settings a bit, I saw a good level of improvement in the vocals, they were clearer than before but overall average. The treble was again very good, the high-frequency sounds were clear & pleasant to ears. The mids were average but overall the audio experience on Boat BassHeads 225 was decent. When listening to music, the overall sound quality is amazing, you can easily distinguish between different instruments & sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphones.

______________________
Noise Isolation & Comfort
-------------------------------------

When it comes to Noise Isolation, Boat BassHeads 225 are very good at it, They come with medium sized ear tip pre-installed which seemed perfect for my ears, once the earphones are on, I wasn't able to hear outside noise, they sealed my ears completely & delivered an immersive experience. Make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation & comfort. Overall Boat BassHeads 225 are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff & somewhat awkward when used for longer periods. Since the housing is made up of metal, you may find them popping out every now & then when used during running, jogging or any other sport or physical activity, this didn't happen as often for me but for a friend, they keep popping out every now & then while running (maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it), An easy solution to this will be using the Ear Hooks which came along with it. When using BassHeads 225 with Ear Hooks, they were a bit uncomfortable initially, but as I got used to them, they were fine, plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on them.

-----------------------------------------
Flat Cable & Microphone
-----------------------------------------

The cable is great, I personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free & comes with a rubberized coating. The cable does its job well. The microphone is again exceptionally good, it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise. During calls, the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance. There is one button on the microphone which helps to pick up/reject calls on the go, without taking your phone out. It can also be used to control music, which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like Boat BassHeads 225.

Warranty & Price
---------------------------------

Boat BassHeads 225 comes with standard One Year Warranty, so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe, in case you need it for warranty.

Final Thoughts!
----------------------

I've personally used Boat BassHeads 225 In-Ear Headphones for more than two weeks (average daily two hours of listening) before writing this review and I'm pretty much impressed with them. I'm personally a fan of Extra Bass IEM's and currently, my primary IEM is Sony MDR-XB50AP which again falls under Extra Bass category. Comparing Sony MDR-XB50AP with Boat BassHeads 225 will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them, but I would still like to add that BassHeads 225 did a great job and didn't disappoint me, obviously it doesn't stand a chance in front of Sony MDR-XB50AP but still looking at the price of BassHeads 225 & the quality they offer, I was really very impressed.

Boat BassHeads 225 turned out to be exceptional earphones, after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices & music players, I can say that they're amazing for the price, a pure steal deal. The bass output is amazing and is very intense, I'll recommend using correct size ear tips & good quality music player like Poweramp (Android) for better bass output. The treble is good & vocals are average, somewhere I feel that bass overpowers the vocals, but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results. The mids are again average.

*****************************
My Rating : 4 out of 5

____________________
The Verdict
---------------------------------

Taking everything into account, overall I'm very impressed with Boat BassHeads 225. The Built quality is amazing, the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass & good overall soundstage. Tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals, mids & highs. Overall the vocal & highs are good & mids are average but still good for the price. I'll recommend these IEM's to bass lovers & budget-conscious people who are looking for high quality & durable earphones at a reasonable price. Genres like EDM, Rock, Hip-Hop sound really great on them. Boat BassHeads 225 justify the price they come for, the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price range.

HOPE I HELPED YOU.

"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- White",B0BS74M665,R2NSGPM3JJXTIO,Great Product,sayan,"I got this at 7999 with debit card cash back. I am using this since last 2 and a half weeks.
My review so far is:

Sound : 5/5
Build quality: 4/5
Mic quality: 3/5
Battery: 5/5
Volume control: 5/5
ANC: 4/5

I will rate this overall 4.5/5
I am not much bothered about mic quality because that’s not my primary use. I got this only for music and it’s serving up to the mark.
Duel device connection works well.
Battery life with ANC will declines little bit fast, although I am using it mostly without ANC.

ANC: It works just fine, it’s a budget ANC headphones so I don’t expect much. Those who have used proper ANC headphones might find this one less efficient. For me it works fine.

Music: Well what can I say? I had used sony a lot in the past, but was pre bluetooth era. This was really a great experience for me. EQ works really well and you can actually spot a difference when you adjust the difference. Sound is crisp and clear. You can really hear all the instruments clearly. Vocals are crispy too, not too much not less they have this little sweet spot! Bass is really great too, although you have to boost it a little bit, but basic settings may also work for you.

App: So far I found app working well, you can connect and disconnect devices within app as well. EQ settings work well too, you can basically create your own custom EQ ( recommended for audiophiles). App looks little cluttered I guess they will change it in future.

Volume: It is crazy loud given the size of drivers they have. I have only used it at 50% volume most of the time when I am at home, hardly went to 70% in public without any ANC. But I recommend you to use ANC if you are surrounded by too much noise in public.

Size and Fit :
These are over the ear, so they fit perfectly fine over your ears. I was actually surprised how good they fit over my ears. Cushions are very well made, have good texture and soft enough to not hurt your ears. The headphones are big enough to be recognised from a distance.

Downsides:
I really hoped they could have given carrying case because headphones themselves are sturdy but they still need protection while carrying.

Also these are not foldable, so carrying them can be little difficult, you may have to purchase a separate carrying case.",2024-10-25,5,11.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point-Connection/dp/B0BS74M665/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2NSGPM3JJXTIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS74M665#R2NSGPM3JJXTIO,2025-01-12T01:52:16.398957,Positive,0.6668257713317871
"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- White",B0BS74M665,R1XZW9OSQEARGJ,"Big Hype for Big Price, Not recommended",Sandy,"I bought this during the Great Indian Festival, and the price was slashed down to 7,998 from its usual price of 9,999. I also got a 10% discount on my SBI card, so the price was close to 7,190. Delighted with the deal, I ordered the black color as my favorite blue was priced 2,000 INR more. I got it delivered within two days, thanks to fast delivery by Amazon, of course, probably if you are a Prime member. After using it for the first 15 minutes, I wasn't quite impressed. I called Amazon Customer Care, but they refused to accept the return, so if you want to buy from Amazon, be sure to try it at a local Sony Shop or Mall if it's available there. So being unable to return the product, I was forced to continue with it, and here are the things I noticed:

Sound quality - To date, based on all the headphones and earphones that I have used, I think it is one of the best. I haven't used top-of-the-line headphones from Sony, Bose, Apple, etc., so the sound quality, based on my audio experience was pretty good. Also, some reviews say it is close to XM5, though there is a slight discernable difference in clarity.

Sony App and EQ Settings- I tried to fine-tune the music to my hearing taste, and the music sounded a bit better. The app asked for a picture of my ear to adjust the sounds according to the acoustics of my ears. I found these features a bit overhyped. While there were some changes in audio, and some features may indeed work, most of these things are hyped as stand-out features for marketing purposes to attract consumers. Also, I have tried using the headphones without these settings, and although there was some difference, it sounded good even without these fine-tunings.

ANC - It cancels out some noises in the background like the buzzing fan on my ceiling, but it's unable to cancel out the sound of my family members speaking around me, the TV audio (even though it is quite far in the drawing room and I am sitting in my bedroom), so it can cancel noise upto a certain degree beyond that it is of no use. I had watched a lot of Tech Reviews of various under 10k headphones before going for this one, they all have a similar problem, ANC works only up to a certain dB of noise, though it is understandable. If you want better ANC, probably go for higher-priced headphones.

Dual pairing and call quality - I use my headphones for many purposes like calling for meetings, listening to music, watching YouTube videos, movies, etc. So, a dual-pairing headphone would have been very much useful for me. While I considered this headphone, this was also one of the features that I had in mind. But the result was disappointing; dual pairing works, but the sound quality deteriorates severely. According to my research, in dual pair mode, it doesn't use the LDAC codec; rather, it uses the SBC/AAC codec, resulting in a deterioration of sound and call quality. In many cases, the person on the other side couldn't even hear clearly what I am saying. So, the call and music quality are both below average, or you may even say poor in dual pairing, which makes this feature irrelevant.

Connectivity - While in dual pair mode, it also experienced connectivity issues. There were times when the headphones got disconnected, and I had to manually switch or reconnect them. Contacting Amazon's customer care regarding this issue didn't help.

Battery life - Before I purchased this, I had seen tech reviews claiming it has amazing battery life. But when I used it (I use it for office work as well as for my entertainment, so I use it 8-12 hours a day), I found that the battery life is not that great. I use it without ANC most of the time as I am working from home. The battery ran for about 3-4 full days, which is 30-35 hours, much below what Sony claims.

Comfort - I have heard in many YouTube tech reviews that it is comfortable, but actually I found it quite opposite. In my opinion, ANC headphones under 10k are a big waste of money, especially if you are in hot and humid regions of India. The reason is that due to ear padding and isolation, your ears will heat up within 30 minutes and sweat, so you have to remove the headphones. Also, even though its padding is soft it's quite tight on the ear, and after 30 minutes of use, it causes discomfort, and you have to remove it.  So, I can't say it's very comfortable. Unless you are working in air-conditioning most of the time in hot and humid climate, it's better to look for TWS buds. If you are looking for noise-cancellation headphones, look for passive noise cancellation headphones that comes at much cheaper price with matching sound quality; there are a few below 3,000 INR which truly sound equally well.

So, to summarize - In my opinion, it is a big hype for the big bucks you spend. If you get this for more than 7,000 INR, it doesn't seem worth it unless you like the brand name. If you are keen on quality ANC headphones then raise your budget; otherwise, at this price, I don't think I am fully satisfied with what it offers.",2023-10-17,1,124.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point-Connection/dp/B0BS74M665/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1XZW9OSQEARGJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS74M665#R1XZW9OSQEARGJ,2025-01-12T01:52:16.398957,Positive,0.8115282654762268
"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- White",B0BS74M665,R1J65WZ5ZSG0B6,Impressive Sound Quality and Decent Noise Cancellation,Sadhna,"I recently purchased this headphone and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is truly remarkable, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience that brings my music and podcasts to life. Whether I'm jamming to my favorite tunes or engrossed in a podcast, the clarity and depth of the sound are truly impressive.

One of the standout features for me is the microphone's noise cancellation capabilities. While it may not completely eliminate all background noise, it does a commendable job of reducing ambient sounds during calls. The result is clear and crisp communication without the distractions of external noise. It's perfect for virtual meetings and online gaming sessions where effective communication is key.

The design of the headphone is sleek and comfortable, making it suitable for extended wear. The over-ear cups provide a snug fit without causing discomfort, and the adjustable headband ensures a customized and secure fit. The build quality also feels robust, indicating durability for everyday use.

I appreciate the user-friendly controls that allow me to adjust volume, skip tracks, and manage calls effortlessly. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, providing a stable connection with my devices without any noticeable lag.

Overall, this headphone is a solid choice for anyone seeking a combination of excellent sound quality and decent noise cancellation. It strikes a great balance between performance and affordability, making it a valuable addition to my audio gear.

"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- White",B0BS74M665,R1OY3ATGXO5QJL,Balanced sound output in this budget of 6190/-,Istiak Alam,"I am using it continuously for last 6 months and gave it 5🌟 overall for the things it offers in the price of just 6k... Yes 6k is just the initiation of good quality ANC bluetooth over the ear headset, people are expecting XM or bose or Sennheiser quality in 6k or 8k,lol....if it's in 8k or 10k range i would give it 4🌟 instead. Here's my findings —

Pros:-

1. Sound output - 4.5/5 ... Default sound is pretty flat, but quickly gets interesting after playing with eq, dsee, anc etc. . Sound volume is pretty average but distortion in max vol. is low. It's a general purpose headset, good enough for all aspects like rock, pop, bass,instrumental, classical, rap etc. . Seperation is nice, different tones have distinct identities. But for specific needs like for bass or vocal, strech your budget a bit more. I don't think you can get better than this balance of sound output in this budget.

2. ANC - 4/5 actually it's pretty decent, but could be a little better. Afterall it's an entry level ANC.

3. Built - 4.5/5 simplistic plastic built, no fancy cosmetics, but solid and mature, very much flexible, not gonna break anytime, good elasticity for sticking with head. Though it's plastic built but has stainless steel housing around stretchable arms which is very nice to have for long term usage. Most headsets break from this sections.

4. Battery- 5/5 fabulous battery life even with anc on . Charging it like smartphones from 20 to 90% and getting about 1 week to 10 days of battery life with intense usage. Charging takes about 50 mins for the above session.

5. Comfort - 4/5 nice padded ear cups, but brings sweat quickly and then feels a bit warm... But prolonged usage doesn't hurt that much as once i had used it about 2hrs at a single strech.

6. Connectivity- 5/5 very strong bluetooth connectivity, works seamlessly even with 10 meters of distance with walls and different floors.
But still not that useful for online gaming via wireless mode as it has a little bit of latency.

Cons. :-
1. Crap when connected to PC via wire and headset turned off.
2. Like other over the ear, gets uncomfortable in scorching summer and humid conditions.
3. Lack of ldac , hence no hi-res audio, but in this price bracket it's ok.
4. Though doesn't feel cheap, but some aesthetics should be there.

Verdict:- You can absolutely go with it if you are getting it around 6000/- for no specific taste. Don't expect it to outperform those ult or XMs, it's illogical to think. If you want the ultimate one then there are XM, momentum, quitecomfort or those beyerdynamics....instead of going with intermediates, either go with this one or go with those super expensive ones. And those people comparing it with much lower priced headphones and saying it worse, they simply don't have the sensitivity to differentiate between subtle frequencies, and those subtle frequencies make it sweet.
'Made for iPhone/iPod' written on the outside of the box, which is strange, probably will work better with ios than android. I'm an android user (pixel) though:).
At last, it's a sweet headphone.

"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- White",B0BS74M665,R1AJLBNNANB200,Great with quirks,Azhar JuMan,"I've been using it for a while and I'm satisfied with the sound quality and the noise cancelling. It has good enough passive noise cancelling already for everyday use and the active noise cancelling makes it amazing to use in noisy environments like a flight or train or even a really loud fan in your room. Music quality is not 'amazing' but it's better than most and nothing to complain about. Battery life is good, and charges back up pretty quick too. Buttons are easy and intuitive to use. Fit and comfort is there, it's closed back so might be uncomfortable to use in hot/humid conditions.

One thing I'm most impressed about is the bluetooth range,  I can keep my phone in my room and walk around wearing the headphones to the next room or the bathroom and it loses no signal, it's great. The strong bluetooth signal unfortunately seems to mess with wifi though, so I see some reduction in wifi speed when this is connected. Could just be a weakness of the wifi chip in my old phone though.

Another quirk is that by default only 2 noise cancellation modes - ambient, and NC (noise cancellation) - were available in the headphones. I had to install the sony headphones app to enable the 3rd mode - off - which is what I use most of the time. Ambient mode lets outside sound like voices in so you can hear people talking even when you're wearing the headphones, but outside of that it sounds noisy and I don't use it all that much. And NC mode is full noise cancellation. If you want to turn it off altogether and use it as a passive headphones you have to install the app and enable the 3rd option.

Overall very happy with my purchase.",2024-10-26,5,2.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point-Connection/dp/B0BS74M665/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1AJLBNNANB200/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS74M665,2025-01-12T01:52:16.398957,Positive,0.9615022540092468
"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- White",B0BS74M665,R20PHSNVCLO50B,I am satisfied with my purchase.,Mohit,"I got it delivered to my home on 26th of October. Since then I am using it , I wanted to test it thoroughly before I write my review.

Build quality: it is well build considering the price 8k which I paid. Though it is all plastic but it is by no means cheap at all. Fit and finish is top notch. The slider is also really good. No problem there.

Padding is good too and it is comfortable to wear because it is light weight (187g).

Try not to slide down unless your head is small or you are a female. The more you slide down, the more you will feel the pressure around your ears.

It seems that it can last 8+ years easily if taken care of them.

Suggestion: Buy a case for this, I bought it for 499 and it is perfect (UniGear Extra Hard Shell Headphone Carrying Case )

Features and sound quality:

Anc: you can expect around 50 to 60% reduction in sound. It's ambience mode is good but not really natural.

Sound Quality: They are really good, not great though but definitely above average. You will feel worth spending 8,000. But above that might not be much of a value.

Very crispy and crystal clear audio. Listen to all types of song and it absolutely fabulous. But listen through a good source I mean through Spotify or Apple music or any paid music platform then only you can actually hear the true sound quality.

Equaliser: Download load the app and you can either use one of the presents it has in the app or you can make your own. I made my own ...
0, +3, +6, +7, +5 and -1 ( bass) for clasic music and for other I like to have +3 (bass) with these settings.

I find that these settings makes the mids more alive and clear.

I didn't find any connection lost issue or any problem with the blutooth connection.

I have watched 2 movies wearing these and the experience is almost like a little theatre. I mean you hear background in so much details, the bass and other sounds just perfect, making the watching movie a very delightful experience.

I have sony earbuds wf-c500 and I find my recent purchase is an absolute upgrade. So definitely happy with my purchase.

Hope I have covered everything.",2024-11-11,5,7.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point-Connection/dp/B0BS74M665/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R20PHSNVCLO50B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS74M665,2025-01-12T01:52:16.398957,Positive,0.9178879261016846
"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- White",B0BS74M665,R36U1PQEZTODKN,"Average at best, SONY's premium price",Amazon Customer,"After much debating on cost to quality ratio between this, XM4 and XM5 (all Sony offerings) and reading tons of reviews here, I settled for this, since it seemed like a balanced option for non-audiophiles. After spending a good amount of time with them, I'm ready to share my thoughts.

First and foremost, let's talk about what Sony has always been known for: sound quality. These headphones do not disappoint in this department. The audio is crisp, clear, and well-balanced, delivering a pleasurable listening experience across a variety of genres. The bass can be punchy but not overwhelming, the mids are smooth, and the highs are sharp without being piercing.

Now, onto the aspect that was a bit of a letdown: the active noise-cancelling. The ANC is, to put it bluntly, below average. This is surely a disappointment since I have seen it struggle with noises even at home, including that of fan. Forget, if you TV on or anything, you would be able to hear all of those noises (though slightly suppressed). I have had ANC over ear headsets before. However, cross checking between this and them, I did feel this does perform slightly better, but that said, yes, dont expect the world to silent by any means. I also found that, though the headphones are light and comfortable, you will definately sweat in them and feel your ears burning after sometime, esp during summer and humid places.
Another point worth mentioning, is I found, which i tilt or move my head, the ANC gets disturbed and you will occasionaly for split seconds notice background noises before ANC resumes again.

The build quality of the headphones is solid, with a design that's sleek and minimalistic, and they are comfortable enough for long listening sessions (except summers maybe!). The battery life is also commendable, easily lasting through a full day of use. There is no case, so take good care of them!

Multidevice works good and decent. There could be lags. I have noticed the headsets dont auto switch off (maybe during mutipoint connect).",2023-10-26,3,5.0,https://amazon.in/Sony-Cancellation-Headphones-Multi-Point-Connection/dp/B0BS74M665/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R36U1PQEZTODKN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS74M665,2025-01-12T01:52:16.398957,Positive,0.9363867044448853

"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancellation Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery- White",B0BS74M665,R1QBQVT83EUQJW,Good but read the following before you finalize it,Aritra Kumar Saha,"After going through various reviews & videos the reason for me going for the Ch720n were three things : The durability, ease of use and sound quality.

Kindly note the following pointers before you finalise this as your go to set of headphones :

1. The sound quality out of the box is not great at all. I had to twerk the eq settings on the sony sound connect app before it started sounding better. The sound dramatically improved with my ""Sound"" app that's free on playstore.
2. If you are into electronica or other modern bass heavy music, the bass becomes a bit too much for this set of headphones to handle.
3. The build quality is excellent with soft cushiony earcups and the presence of physical buttons makes it easier for me to operate.
4. The battery life is excellent and there are no complains regarding it.

Overall, if you're looking for the best set of headphones under 10k, this would be it but I would still not be comfortable spending more than 6k on these. However, with the Soundcore space one as it's competitor in this price range which offers many features that this does not have, I would still opt for these solely because of the sound quality and durability.

Drop volume 3 points, it will still be loud. Now everything will be perfect. Good for multimedia consumption. Clear and crisp sound. Never faced any problem with the mic.

I bought this piece in March 2022. It was at a good price then. I bought it for gaming and listening music. This headset is the best one I could recommend to anyone.After 2 years, I have no complaint against this device. This device is the best at its price range. The only downside I experienced is1. Feels a little discomfort after wearing for long time.2. The sound is fading very slowly after 2 successful years. Looks like it's dying. When I bought this device 100% volume is so high that it could break your eardrum so I used to listen it at 50%. Now, 100% volume seems like 20 - 40% volume.3. When at 100% volume, hearing a song feels bit awkward like it seems to have some disturbance. We may feel disturbed.But 80% volume is nice, decent, and best for it's price. Nice bass not best but decent.4. When I bought this device, the mic was pretty good. But now after 2 years, while recording or talking, my voice may feel shattered or breaking in between. Maybe because it's too old. But as a new one, you may not experience anything.Overall, it's a budget friendly, good headset  for everyone.

1. Audio is all good.
2. Fit is also good.

Cons -
1. At full volume the buds start to vibrate. Making it very uncomfortable to wear. So full volume will not be comfortable.
2. Faced an issue - As soon as i switch to spatial audio, the buds simply switch off. They offered to replace it but found the feature very gimmicky. So was ok with it.

The sound quality is absolutely incredible – rich, deep, and crystal clear. The mic performs great, making calls smooth, and the sound isolation helps me stay focused on my studies. As a student, it's a perfect choice, especially when compared to brands like Noise or BoAt in the same price range. The premium feel of these headphones really stands out.

What really sets the Blash Max apart is the design. The 180-degree rotation ensures they stay safe from damage when not in use, unlike other headsets that can break or tilt. The soft cushions and matte finish make long online classes and study sessions comfortable. Plus, they're ideal for outdoor activities, traveling, and gym workouts – they won’t fall off like buds, which is a huge bonus. Covering the full ear, they provide a much better experience than typical on-ear headphones.

The build quality is fantastic, and the customer support team is quick and responsive if you ever need assistance. The only slight drawback is the charging time, but once charged, the call quality is premium and clear, and the music is immersive. What really impressed me is the touch controls – something you rarely find in other brands at this price.

"JBL C50HI, Wired in Ear Headphones with Mic, One Button Multi-Function Remote, Lightweight & Comfortable fit (Black)",B07JQKQ91F,R3HNVLK5IJIZUT,Great Sound Quality at an Affordable Price,Paramjit Singh,"I recently bought the JBL C50HI Wired In-Ear Headphones and have been pleasantly surprised by their performance, especially given their budget-friendly price.

Pros:

Excellent Sound Quality: The sound quality is impressive for the price. The bass is punchy, the mids are clear, and the highs are crisp. It provides a balanced audio experience that enhances music listening and calls.

Comfortable Fit: The in-ear design fits comfortably in the ears. The earbuds come with multiple sizes of ear tips, allowing for a snug and personalized fit that helps with passive noise isolation.

One Button Multi-Function Remote: The single button remote is convenient for controlling playback and handling calls. It’s easy to use and responsive.

Durable Build: Despite the low price, the build quality feels solid. The cables are well-constructed and less prone to tangling, which is a plus.

Cons:

No Noise Cancellation: While the in-ear design provides some passive noise isolation, these headphones do not have active noise cancellation. They may not be ideal for very noisy environments.

Microphone Quality: The microphone is functional but could be better. It works well for calls but might pick up background noise in louder settings.

Overall: The JBL C50HI Wired In-Ear Headphones offer fantastic value for their price. With great sound quality, comfort, and a handy remote, they are a solid choice for anyone looking for reliable and affordable in-ear headphones.

Here's a breakdown of what you can expect after listening to them for a while:

Pros:

Punchy Bass: These earphones live up to the JBL name by delivering satisfying bass that makes music enjoyable, especially bass-heavy genres like hip-hop and EDM.
überraschend (überraschend is German for surprisingly) Clear Mids and Highs: Despite the bass focus, the mids and highs aren't totally drowned out. You can still hear vocals and instruments clearly.
Comfortable Fit: Thanks to the included ear tips in various sizes, you can find a snug fit that provides passive noise isolation and keeps the earphones securely in place.
Built-in Microphone and Remote: The one-button remote lets you control music playback and answer calls conveniently, perfect for everyday use.
Affordable Price: The JBL C50HI is a budget-friendly option, making it a good choice for those who prioritize sound quality without breaking the bank.
Cons:

Lacks Durability Concerns: Some user reviews mention concerns about the build quality, particularly regarding the cable’s longevity.
Nicht besonders (Nicht besonders is German for not particularly) Noise Cancelling: These earphones rely on a snug fit for passive noise isolation, but they won't completely block out ambient noise.
Limited Call Quality: While the microphone allows for calls, reviews suggest the microphone quality might not be the best for clear conversations in noisy environments.
Overall:

The JBL C50HI wired in-ear headphones are a solid choice for budget-minded listeners who prioritize clear sound with a punchy bass. The comfortable fit, built-in microphone, and affordable price tag add to their appeal. However,  be mindful of potential durability concerns  and the  lack of active noise cancellation.

Recommendation:

If you're looking for a good balance of sound quality, affordability, and convenience for everyday use, the JBL C50HI is worth considering.  However, if durability or crystal-clear call quality are your top priorities, you might want to explore other options.",2024-03-31,5,5.0,https://amazon.in/JBL-C50HI-Ear-Headphones-Black/dp/B07JQKQ91F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1RUR0Y7H70YM5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07JQKQ91F,2025-01-12T01:58:13.278750,Positive,0.8783813714981079

=== Whats different from C200SI? ===
* C50HI is lighter than C200SI (5 grams) - Good
* C50HI has an L-shaped 3.5 mm jack - Good
* C50HI does not have a gold plated 3.5 mm jack - Bad
* Build quality is average compared to C200SI  - Bad
* The one button universal remote button design is different. C200SI has a better quality one  - Bad
* Quality of wire is better in C200SI  - Bad

Pros:
1. Design and Build Quality: Considering the price, design is great and satisfactory build quality too. Except the microphone area, it does look classy.
2. Great comfort and fitting inside the ear - thanks to the good quality plastics which makes it light weight and the soft silicone ear tips.
3. Snug fit and excellent noise isolation inside the air.
4. Superb sound quality. You get almost similar sound experience offered in C200SI which is priced ₹300 more.
5. The Bass is also good and it is same in the other JBL earphones in this segment.
6. The 3.5mm L-shaped jack is a nice addition in this range.
7. Passive noise cancellation with the built-in mic works as expected.

Cons:
1. Average quality of the plastic built One-Button Universal Remote button. Unlike C100SI/C150SI/C200SI, the click happens to the whole half of the button instead of a round button.
2. Wire quality could have been better, but cannot complain much due to this ultra budget range in which it is offered.
3. Gold plated 3.5 mm jack would have been a good addition, since you get this in models starting from JBL C100SI which is just priced ₹100 more.
4. In comparison with C200SI, the microphone of C100SI captures a little more noise but also you get a clearer sound along with. C200SI recording feels less noisy but sound is also a bit muffled due to passive noise cancellation.

Note:
The one which i got delivered first time had a defect - one of the earpiece had less volume compared to the other. Replacement got approved and the new one works great as expected, hence no issues.

If you are in a very tight budget, this could be considered, else you can go for JBL C200SI which has the same sound quality but with a better build and a gold plated 3.5 mm jack.
Also please pay extra attention during the usage since there is a high chance to get damaged due to the thin wires.",2020-06-22,5,4.0,https://amazon.in/JBL-C50HI-Ear-Headphones-Black/dp/B07JQKQ91F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RK3JNNBJ71P09/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07JQKQ91F,2025-01-12T01:58:13.278750,Neutral,0.49781855940818787

In 1700 the build is great it's justifies the price the buttons are steady and properly working just one issue that after a long time of use I feel slight pain in my left year but may be it is just me. Also these earbuds are very easy to carry in pockets so don't worry the material is very flexible and strongANC:- ANC is pretty descent I never used any earbuds before having any ANC features(previously I used Boat Nirvana ION) it's my first time using it and its good I mean in bus or train it will gonna help me to get rid of unwanted sounds to be honest it cuts 30-40% of outside sounds its descent.Sound Quality:- Guyz TBH The Sound Quality is amazing let me explain it in detail. So vocals are crystal clear no issue in that. The trebles are amazing. I mean when you listen the songs you will gonna notice all kinds of instruments that are used in the music and also all the small small details you will definitely going to hear those too. I mean the sound seperations are just on point in this price. Let's talk about BASS and if you are a BASS lover just buy it. I am a Basshead I love Extra boosted heavy BASS and these earbuds are made for it. Also you can customise the soundtype in app settings so don't worry... overall its best in sound quality I am in love with this earbuds.App:- As I mentioned earlier that this earbuds supports realme link app which means there are a lots of customizations which you can do in the app such as there are 4 eq modes1. Vocals: Basically focuses on movie or videos or if you joined classes using this its good.2.Original sound: In this mode the music will feel flat with no base but clear audio.3.pure bass: This is the same as original sound but with bass which I am using it will give clear vocals thumpy bass and amazing trebles.4. Deep Bass: in this mode the Bass will going to takeover the vocals and trebles and all you can feel is Heavy BASS.There are more features like You can customize the Bass by activating the Bass function, You can turn on ANC, Transperancy or Off the ANC in the app.Spatial audio: Sometimes it can create a good 3d surround sounds but not everytime so its just 50-50 like watching movies in this mode will give you a good experience.Game mode without the game mode you can feel the latency but after turning it on the latency reduces if you are a casual gamer and play games for fun I mean daily 2-3 hrs of gameplay just to enjoy with friends  and hangout with them you will going to enjoy it but if you are looking for professional gaming this is not the right one for you.Extras:- it has bluetooth 5.3 and magnetic off and on feature which I am loving in this as soon as you seprate those earbuds it will get connected instantly that's good I have used Boat nirvana ION and I lost the case and I bought this and one thing I can say that this is far better then those the sound quality build features ANC as well as in everything if you are buying it don't think just trust me you never going to regret....

"Realme Buds Wireless 3 in-Ear Bluetooth Headphones,30dB ANC,Spatial Audio,13.6mm Dynamic Bass Driver,Upto 40 HrsPlayback,Fast Charging,45ms Low Latency for Gaming,Dual Device Connection-Vitality White",B0C8VKRLRY,RVF9Z5GS6HACL,Total worth..,Khushbu Chaudhary,"I have used it for couple of hours and I can say it's real good. Thing is i used to use OnePlus bullets wireless z2, but they stopped working two weeks back. I was about to buy them again because those were beauties but then i saw a news about this thing coming on 12, I am not a fan of realme but i thought why not give them a  try, I bought them as soon as they went live and got them today. Here are my initial impressions.Sound (5/5)- Sound is Very rich and clear  you can clearly hear all the notes and the bass is real good too, I think it's par with my oneplus if not better, the spatial audio makes it even better but that could be personal preference. They support dolby atmos, they have inbuilt equalizer support (with app), gaming mode, volume enhancer, dynamic bass and spatial audio. So they have covered almost every aspect.Size (3/5) - Size it too big if I compare it with oneplus and you can feel them hanging on your neck, could have been compact.Call (5/5) - So far I have received couple of call and they work fine almost as good as oneplus bullets wireless z2 and those were one of the best earbuds for calling even when driving bike or cycling.Controls (5/5) - They have done a good work with the controls, you can do almost everything with the band what you can do with app.Comfort (3/5) - As I said size could have been smaller and that would have made them more comfortable, also the eartips could have been better.Battery (5/5) - I think anything with more than 15 hours with fast charging is a good deal.ANC (5/5) - ANC and transparency work fine, I use Samsung galaxy buds pro so these are as good as them if not better.App support (5/5) - you can do more things with the app so that's there, and because of that they can push firmware updates and make it even better.It can connect to 2 devices is the best part, now I can seamlessly watch tv and use phone, without having to connect or disconnect each time.I think this one has all the things you can ask for 1700 bucks, just have to see how long they will serve me.So far I am happy because I chose them over oneplus bullets wireless z2.Will update the review later if I feel to add something or if I face any problems.UPDATE 1- The headphones are performing better than I expected, the sound is amazing and they can be so loud that you have to listen to them at 50% volume, transparency and ANC are working good too, and you can even feel subtle vibrations in your ear when you are watching an action sequence on tv (which is the best part about my soundcore q20 headphones) and this is the first earphone being able to do that.Today I used them in heavy rain, it was drizzling dense and they worked just fine.So only drawback so far is the comfort (I guess my ears would adjust to them in time) and the size which is too big, the magnetic portion could have been round so that they would align perfectly, also the design could have been better by making the edges round rather then edgy but that's how I feel and it depends on personal preference.Hope this will help you in your purchasing decision.UPDATE 2- After using it for almost a month I can say that it's a good neckband to buy, let me put cons and prons here.Prons1. Good Battery Life (5-10 Minutes of charge gives it a day worth of Juice.) a full charge can last for 2-3 days and I use it heavily.2. Sound is good, it's loud and Anc is good too.3. App customization is there and it's good.4. Bass and loudness is great too, I haven't listened to it on full volume except in heavy traffic.5. So far haven't had any call quality issues.6. You can control almost everything with the built in buttons.7. Best part is 2 device support and it's really seamless to use it with TV and using phone at the same time.ConsComfort could have been better if they had provided better eartips.Size is a bit bigger for my taste, could have been little compact.There is a constant delay and distortion of voice while watching you tube videos at 2X. Hope they will fix it with a firmware update.",2023-07-17,5,999.0,https://amazon.in/Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones-HrsPlayback-Connection-Vitality/dp/B0C8VKRLRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RVF9Z5GS6HACL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8VKRLRY,2025-01-12T03:03:07.115218,Positive,0.7070131897926331

Audio Driver - 13.6 mmBass - 9.5 out of 10 (why 9.5 see below)Clarity - 10 on 10 (if I would give the superb bass 10 on 10, then how could I explain its ultimate magnitude of clarity? To all music lovers who are absolute concern about bass, go for it with your eyes closed. I tested it with many formats of sound, even with 24 bit Flac, your ears will start to get shaken. And bass isn't thumpy until you deal with equalizers beyond your knowledge.During calling I had to ask 'pardon?' for two times. But it doesn't make much of sense as the other ends of my calls might not put their mic properly.Mic - As a voice recorder, it is absolute nice.Battery life: Nice. You'll get 40 hpurs as stipulated in one charge.Functionality - The mic has thrre functions, ANC, Refined Sound works good.Gaming - Here I would be better to remain silent as I'm not a gamer.Appearance - I purchased the black & yellow combination and it looks good to me. Obviously, the black & white is more gorgeous but it is a matter related to maintaining.Endurance: As other BT neckbands are; here you won't get nothing special.BT Connectivity: It works perfectly nice up to 40 feet distance (up to that far I tested).Reminder: After receiving the product, don't forget to scan the QR code and log in to realme site.

boAt BassHeads 100 in-Ear Wired Headphones with Mic (White),B07234XXJF,R1U132V6L8LZKD,Excellent Sound Quality at an Affordable Price!,Sid,"These earphones offer fantastic value for money, making them a great choice for music lovers on a budget.

Pros:
1. Impressive Sound Quality: The bass performance is exceptional, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience. Whether I’m listening to music or watching videos, the sound quality is clear and powerful.
2. Stylish Design: The Furious Red color gives these earphones a bold and attractive look. They stand out, and I appreciate the sleek design that complements my style.
3. Comfortable Fit: The in-ear design comes with multiple ear tips, allowing me to find the perfect fit. They stay securely in place, even during workouts or long listening sessions.
4. Built-in Microphone: The mic works well for phone calls and voice commands. The sound quality during calls is clear, making conversations easy and hassle-free.
5. Tangle-Free Cable: The cable is made from a durable material that resists tangling, which is a huge plus for me. It makes storage and transport much more convenient.
6. Affordable Price: Given their performance and quality, these earphones are very reasonably priced. They offer great value compared to many other brands in the market.

Cons:
1. Limited Noise Isolation: While the earphones provide decent passive noise isolation, they may not completely block out external sounds in noisy environments. Users seeking a more immersive experience might want to consider noise-canceling options.
2. Cable Durability: Although the cable is tangle-free, it might be prone to wear and tear with heavy usage. Care should be taken to avoid pulling or bending it excessively.
3. Sound Signature: The bass-heavy sound signature may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those who prefer a more balanced sound profile. It might overpower mids and highs in certain music genres.
4. No Inline Controls: While the microphone is handy for calls, there are no inline controls for volume or playback, which can be inconvenient for some users.

Overall:
The boAt Bassheads 100 in Ear Wired Earphones (Furious Red) are an excellent choice for anyone seeking quality sound and comfort at an affordable price. With impressive bass, a stylish design, and a comfortable fit, they’re perfect for daily use. Despite minor drawbacks like limited noise isolation and sound signature, I highly recommend them for anyone looking for budget-friendly earphones that deliver great performance!",2024-09-28,4,10.0,https://amazon.in/boAt-BassHeads-100-Headphones-White/dp/B07234XXJF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1U132V6L8LZKD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07234XXJF,2025-01-12T03:04:02.188379,Positive,0.9798915982246399

"OneOdio Over Ear Headphone Studio Wired Bass Headsets with 50mm Driver, Foldable Lightweight Headphones with Shareport and Mic for DJ Monitoring Mixing Guitar PC TV",B0CKZ17Y3Y,RA9FJT5B12OUH,Totally worth it.,Yaman Singh Bhati,"Back Story :
I was very Skeptical at First about it, Since it's a New Company. But all the YT reviews and Amazon convinced me.
My Phillips O'Neil Stretch recently broke due to winters probably, They were with me for 5 yrs and before that I had Sennheiser (forgotten the model) Both models are not made anymore.

Review after 3 Hrs of usage :
The headphones look pretty fine at first look ,The packaging was ehhhh , I've received Pen Drive in Better Packaging from Flipkart But since they were ok soo .
When You first lift the headphones (Not gonna lie) they feel broken coz the cups are too free , They were bigger than I expected tho, from pics on amazon I thought they were gonna be on the ear but they were over the ear tho I've small ears . The cables , the 3M long 6.5mm cable feel quite sturdy but probably will last 2yrs if used carefully ( I'll try my best, tho I'm a rough user ) but the cable stil could've been better, the phillips one was braided and is still like new and they've been through a lot from gyms to crazy cardios.

Now the main Thing Soundddddddddd
This THis this THIS is the thing which took all the points, the sound is better than most headphones under 10K . Tho I use equalizer adn Dolby Atmos always in every headphones Since I've different moods at different times. Without equalizer the company settings are pretty good too the sound is very crispy most of the times and it also doesn't lack in songs with bass you can distinguish the sounds the vocals hitting from top ,instruments from back and little deep bass . But with the equalizer I use ""Boom Audio"" ""Dolby atmos official app"" just delivers what I need and give me just the Surround Sound I need , almost all headphones are callibrated for all purpose but equalizers give you just what you need Good Equalizers tho.

You can use these for games too altough I don't play but I tested them in Atmos and it was good BUt the Microphones isn't that good and i prefer the 3M cable the another one seem rather cheap.

The comfort uhhhhh You can't get everything perfect ,they're just adequate , i was tight on budget or else i would've went for pro30 they seem more comfortable , my ears started hurting after an hour or soo especially my earlobes , since I wear ear studs , I had to adjust a little . I use headphones for 8 some hours and i could easily wear the phillips one for 4hrs without realising OneOdio should've them atleast oval instead of round, Oval is better for both comfort and noise cancellation.
SUM UP :
Pros :
1) One of the Best Sound you'll get under 10K
2) Good Looking
3) Adequate Comfort
4) Connectivity, Cable
5) with right settings you can get just any sound you want

Cons :
1) Should've been Oval
2) cable and microphone(although complimentary ) could've been better.

P.S. the sound in first 15 sec of video is factory set and later is equalizer set you probably can't tell difference that way hardly can I lol but you can once they're on your head, and also i use the device in last to use them as Bluetooth headphones but i don't think i can use them like phillips , the device will hit my shoulder on these one.",2020-12-18,5,4.0,https://amazon.in/OneOdio-Headphone-Lightweight-Headphones-Monitoring/dp/B0CKZ17Y3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RA9FJT5B12OUH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_img?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKZ17Y3Y,2025-01-12T03:05:05.699313,Positive,0.595815896987915

Good, balanced sound. Comfortable ear pads, have worn them for upwards of 4-5 hours without feeling any fatigue.

Almost 8 months later, the headphones work perfectly, the headband is tearing slightly, I find this to be normal with my continuous use, and ear pads also show signs of wear (also normal).

The cables that come in the box still work perfectly. I used the one without the mic primarily and it still looks good and works perfectly.

Plastics look the price, not cheap but not super high quality either. Some of the plastics are a little creaky.

The bag that comes with it is of good quality and I have used it regularly, pack the headphones in and throw it in a backpack. Only shows signs of normal wear.

There is no noise isolation, so if you're looking for a headphone you can use outside, this ain't it.

I was looking for a headset for my daily use for gaming and netflix, hence was not looking for premium headphones. Saw good reviews of this one and went ahead with it
Audio Quality
I was pleasantly surprised that it surpassed my earlier headphone in terms of bass and deepness of the audio. Had to reduce volume to a third of previous set levels on all devices, so its loud. I’m not a fan of loud bass tuned headphones but liked this one as it doesn’t go overboard with it. I noticed that i’m able to hear dialogues more clearly despite a deeper base in background music

Design
I liked the design while unboxing it - sturdy plastic, strong hinges, leatherette cushions. However, its actually on-the-ear headphone rather than over-the-ear and the ear cups press down hard on your ears making them pain over long duration usage. The ears also gets hot pretty quickly as material is not breathable. I hope over time it eases off.
They have given headphone jack on both ear cups which are also detachable, which is very useful

Accessories
It comes with a carry bag for travel which was a nice touch. I was again pleasantly surprised when i saw that it comes with 2 wires - 3.5 to 3.5 (length is short ☹️) and 3.5 to 6.35mm (long length 😊).

If you’re someone who likes to listen to a balanced sound signature as opposed to bass heavy headphones, then this is the perfect product for you. I am not saying that bass is poor on these headphones, you can definitely hear it but you may not feel that extra thump you might find on Sony products. The noise cancelling is just out of the world. For flights and long bus journeys, the headphones will drown out enough of the ambient noise to let you sleep peacefully. The ear cups and headband are soft and comfortable enough for long hours of listening. The ear cups are also really deep so most ear types won’t touch the driver enclosure. The Bose app is also well designed and easy to use. The immersive audio feature is great for certain songs and for watching shows, but it won’t work well with every song. I prefer to have it turned off to get more battery life. I can get a week’s worth of battery out of each charge (I listen to music for about 3-4 hours per day at 50-60% volume). The hinges and other components of these headphones feel sturdy and well built. You can go ahead and get these without a second thought. However, if you’re someone who makes a lot of phone calls from your headphones, or if you’re a bass head, you might want to consider other options like the XM5, since they have better microphones and a warmer, bass heavy sound signature.",2024-10-22,5,3.0,https://amazon.in/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R32V6A63QZMJP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCZ1L489,2025-01-12T03:06:14.685913,Positive,0.6864978075027466

"Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones with Spatial Audio, Over-The-Ear Headphones with Mic, Up to 24 Hours of Battery Life, Black",B0CCZ1L489,R3L8EQIOSUEYB9,Buy Other Sound Equipment,Arvind,"I have been using the AirPods Pro 2 daily and the Shokz OpenRun for walks and the gym.

I was considering getting a pair of headphones (1) for better sound quality and (2) for better noise cancellation.

I went ahead with the purchase on October 19th at a price of approximately ₹22,000.

Mistakes/assumptions:

 1. A higher price means better performance: The AirPods Max still uses Apple’s H1 chip. Despite its exorbitant price, it doesn’t compete with the AirPods Pro 2, which uses the Apple H2 chip. Mark Ellis Reviews has done a video on this, and I compared sound quality reviews against these as a benchmark.
 2. Being a class leader in ANC means their sound quality must also be somewhat on par.
 3. Not doing A/B testing for sound quality before buying.

I was listening to music on my AirPods when I received the delivery. My first impression upon wearing the Bose QC Ultra was disappointment in how lackluster the sound quality was. I tried adjusting the EQ but didn’t notice much of an improvement.

I tried out its unique selling point (USP), Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), but it was nothing remarkable.

Immersive Audio: A gimmicky attempt at replicating Apple’s Spatial Audio. It sounds very processed and artificial, unlike Spatial Audio, which feels natural.

Popping sound when walking: There is a noticeable popping sound when walking, which makes the headphones usable only while at your desk. There is a Reddit thread indicating that this is a known issue.

Tips for achieving high-quality output:

 • On the Apple Music app, turn on Hi-Res Lossless.

TL;DR:

 • Noise cancellation: 8/10
 • Sound quality: 2/10
 • Spatial Audio (Immersive Audio): 1/10

In terms of sound quality, the AirPods Pro 2 and Shokz are in a different league compared to the Bose QC Ultra, which, even if sold for ₹5,000 to ₹8,000, is not worth the price.

Note: There are no returns after purchase.

Update : Bose is refusing to address the popping sound issue. Amazon will be checking with them and are expected to get back to me by 5th of November. Will update the progress here.",2024-10-20,1,7.0,https://amazon.in/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3L8EQIOSUEYB9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCZ1L489,2025-01-12T03:06:14.685913,Positive,0.6351454257965088

The headphones do a fantastic job of blocking out ambient noise, making them ideal for long flights or noisy work environments. The sound quality is also exceptional, with a well-balanced sound profile that delivers crisp highs and rich lows. Additionally, the headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods thanks to their plush ear cushions and lightweight design.

One downside to the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones is the high price point, which may be a deterrent for some consumers. Additionally, some users have noted that the touch controls on the headphones can be finicky and difficult to use.

I’ve got this one just about 24 hrs back, thanks to Amazon Shopping Festival with Axis Bank credit card, I landed up paying around ₹25,300/- for it.
The delivery experience with Amazon Prime was flawless and the product delivered within 36 hrs of placing the order.
Packing is good and reminds of Apple unboxing.
The first thing that comes to mind on using the product is its weight. Perhaps the lightest in its category. The head cushion is comfortable and even after using it for 2-3 hrs at a stretch one shouldn’t feel uncomfortable.
The battery charging is quick, from ~50% to full charge taking around 30 mins with a Type C fast charger.
Bluetooth connectivity is seamless with iPhone and the first-time pairing happens effortlessly.
However, while comparing with the Apple AirPod ProMax that am using since a year, the spatial sound experience is not as great. The additional volume control buttons in Apple is more convenient. Besides, with the Apple product, it switches seamlessly between all Apple devices based on what you’re attending to, something this doesn’t.
Overall, it’s a good product for single device usage, perhaps better than most others in its category, but definitely falls short of Apple.
Thought of adding this additional aspect after over a month of using the product. While using the headphone and listening to anything on your phone, every time a call comes, you’ll have to manually select your headphone for attending it, unlike on my Apple AirPod Max, where it automatically shifts to the call and back.",2024-09-30,4,3.0,https://amazon.in/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RLHGHQLT6B02B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCZ1L489,2025-01-12T03:06:14.685913,Positive,0.9699380397796631

It automatically disconnects from one device in less than a minute.
Two devices dont stay connected for greater than a minute, the device in which media is not playing gets disconnected
To connect to the first device again
1) i have to disconnect from the second device
2) unpair(yes unpair) it from the first device
3) restart the headphones re-pair in the first device as if connecting for the first time to make it work
Repeat the same steps everytime you want to switch between devices.
After digging through reviews and comments on YouTube this is a issue with every unit not only mine
Also auto connectivity sometimes works sometimes doesn't work
Aux cable is a joke, only left side audio is delivered, the pin is too long to inside some devices so doesn't work on them
2000 rupees product advertised as bluetooth headphones having it's basic functionalities flawed is unacceptable.

Regarding sound quality: Its mediocre, there is a noticeable distortion at higher volumes, bass is non existent, even though I don't like bass that much there is serious lack of bass, i have to adjust it with equalizer to make it decent
Faint sounds are barely hearable even at max volume
This is my first time using headphones and i can figure out flaws quite easily
My rockerz 255 neo neckband has far superior sound quality
So anyone with even a remote love for audio quality or any dual device work should not consider buying this

Comfort : it's okayish,  i get sweaty inside earcups, for me it works like over-ear(completely covers from top to bottom end) but my ears are also very small in size
Weight is manageable(idk what to expect never used one before). It gets slightly uncomfortable after an 30 mins or so on ears. Personally i get jaw pain.
Battery : good
Build/Durability : good for now, also this is a
PU leather, it will wear and tear as usage continues + cushions doesn't seem replaceable (which is fine at this price)
Latency : good i would consider it for gaming, u will get used to it
In conclusion i regret buying it, i bought it mainly for long time usage and dual device connectivity, both of which are not full filled

"AKG K52 Closed Back Headphones,Wired,Black",B019EACGSU,R36IU3ZY54NSE5,Excellent headphones for music,Amazon Customer,"Reviewing after more than a year of use:

(5 stars for sound / 4 stars for build quality)

AKG is an Austrian company, now owned by Harman International of the famous harman/kardon brand of hi-fi equipment and JBL.

If you're looking for a good pair of budget headphones for an Immersive listening experience, the K92 is perfect. They may not be the best looking ones, but the metal frame makes them quite sturdy, while most expensive brands are made completely of plastic.

I bought these headphones purely for listening to music via my computer. The ear cups of my previous (decent) AKG K52s had become scruffy so I wanted to change and after scouting several hi-fi audio websites, decided to upgrade to the K92 which had good recommendations as opposed to the K72.

The headphones deliver crisp, clear sound with no or minimal distortion (depending on your audio source or file). They have have a good audio frequency bandwidth (16 - 22000 Hz) which provides a wide dynamic range which means you get bold bass and clear treble. The low impedence of 32 ohms means that the headphones can be driven easily at low volume by a computer sound card without the need for an additional amplifier. A 40 mm driver delivers good bass which is not too punchy, but just right since these are studio monitoring headphones.

On the downside, I am already noticing slight wear on the earcups (which I believe are replaceable).

Overall, for the price, the AKG 92 is a steal. If you're into classical music, jazz, easy or popular music, I'd recommend these highly. Go for them without a doubt.

Pros:

* 40 mm driver delivers good low bass frequencies (not too punchy)

* Low impedence (32 ohms) gives clear sound at low volume

* Audio frequency bandwidth: 16 - 22000 Hz gives bold bass, good midtone and clear treble (very good for the price)

* Earcups fit well (tightly) over the ears providing passive noise cancelling (not active)

* Very enjoyable for classical music, jazz, popular and general listening

* Fairly decent build quality (metal frame as opposed to full plastic)

Cons:

* Earcups degrade after a year of use

* As with any over ear headphones, your ears become hot after prolonged use (should not be a problem in cold weather or an air-conditioned environment)

* None otherwise",2023-06-26,5,40.0,https://amazon.in/AKG-K52-Closed-Back-Headphone-Black/dp/B019EACGSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R36IU3ZY54NSE5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019EACGSU#R36IU3ZY54NSE5,2025-01-12T03:09:43.656436,Positive,0.7075963616371155

"AKG K52 Closed Back Headphones,Wired,Black",B019EACGSU,R5NZE9Z04FZ3U,good buy!,gecs,"i'm not an audiophile, or someone who makes/produces music, so i didn't buy these with the intent of using them as ""studio monitors"". i just needed a set of comfortable, over-ear 'phones primarily for home use (not commute) that both look and sound good and don't cost a lot. very casual, regular usage; no professional stuff. and for someone with similar requirements, i would definitely implore them to check these out.

i love the design. no complaints wrt the material used. incidentally, i was planning on buying the cheaper k52s because of their all black body, but i decided against it because i prefer the cushioning on this one. the look is great too. these are probably the only pair of headphones that don't make me look crazy.

the comfort is decent. lmao i actually forgot that these have no adjustable slider thing and instead have the self-adjusting headband, but either way, it feels okay. the earcups are huge and so would completely engulf anyone's ears. i'm 6', have a relatively large head and ears, so these were actually good for me. none of that sharp pain you get from on-ears.
caveat: when you wear these, if your ears are big, especially if they are more ""out"" (basically, protrude outward from your head in a more noticeable way), then they might touch the inside of the cans, which feels... weird, for sure. it doesn't cause like immense discomfort, but it's still weird and does cause some strain after a while because your ears are literally pressing against the inside of the cup. also, after a while, your ears might feel warm too. not hot, just slightly warm.

the cord is, yes, very long. again, not a problem for me because i'm not using these while commuting. and i don't think these are sweatproof, waterproof, foldable, etc., but then again they're not made to be used on public transit 💀 the context of use matters. they're meant for the studio and yeah, since we're all holed up in our houses anyway, they're great for use inside the house too, granted all you do is just listen to music and chill.

the sound quality is not remarkable or anything, but it's good enough! you won't find me raving about these for ""how amazing they sound"", but they do sound very good, especially for the price. no complaints with the sound quality esp. given the price.
although, a comparable alternative would be the oneodio headphones that a lot of reviewers really like and i did also consider them, but (personally) their design was too tacky and too close to an on-ear pair which only means one thing for people with big ears: pain. but yeah, none of that ""extra bass"" bs that i absolutely detest. the music sounds clear and balanced.

caveat: i keep reaching for the wire to change the song constantly forgetting that this doesn't have button controls (or even a mic, but hey, can't complain too much) 😭 if you're someone who does want these extra features, check out the oneodio pair for sure.
also, the noise cancellation on these is... not good, period. like ""i could hear my fan through these when i wasn't playing anything"" not good. it's not terrible, but it's just not there, really.

and okay, i know there's a whole conversation about studio/monitor headphones not being compatible with regular smartphones involving a lot of technical jargon (""impedance"", ""impedance matching"", etc.), but i don't think you'd have to worry about that stuff with these. i use these with my redmi note 10 pro to listen to spotify, google podcasts, local music and also to watch videos/movies on youtube, netflix, prime video and i haven't encountered any issues! i believe they'd work just fine with any modern smartphone.

in all, these are a great pair and i would say i'm satisfied with my purchase!",2021-07-23,4,65.0,https://amazon.in/AKG-K52-Closed-Back-Headphone-Black/dp/B019EACGSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R5NZE9Z04FZ3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019EACGSU,2025-01-12T03:09:43.656436,Positive,0.9034850001335144
"AKG K52 Closed Back Headphones,Wired,Black",B019EACGSU,R3AHJEY47Q5NDZ,Amazing but it's not for everyone,Sreekar,"So, here's some context before you read this... I am not an audio engineer or a seasoned audiophile by any means. That word gets thrown around a lot these days. I own a pair of Airpods Pro and needed a pair of secondary headsets for the following reasons. If you only want to know what they sound like, I've written about it at the end.

1. Comfort: I needed something light weight and over-ear since the Airpods can start causing discomfort to your ears if you use them over prolonged periods of time. The AKG K52's are amazing at this. You'll pretty much forget that you have them on. One thing to remember here is that if you're in a hot environment, you could sweat around where the ear pads are. Overall, my ears are thanking me for this decision.

2. Lossless Audio: If you own Bluetooth earphones like the Airpods/Airpods Pro/any Bluetooth headset, you'd be aware that it doesn't support lossless audio on Apple Music. If you'd really like to take a crack at that, these are some of the cheapest headsets with 40mm drivers. Your next best options are by Audio Technica but they cost significantly more. Since I was only looking for a secondary pair, this was a good middle ground.

3. Not worry about batteries: Owning bluetooth headsets can be agonising if you wanna listen for long hours. Especially since in between I'm just watching random YouTube videos. So, I decided to pick up these wired ones.

How do they sound?
A: Well, they sound great but this largely depends on your taste in music. They have a very neutral sound profile. If I had to point out the biggest difference between Airpod Pro's and these is 'Immersion'. These definitely don't feel as immersive as more expensive headsets but that would be unfair to expect at the price.

I'm not saying they're ""good for the price"", they're just good in general. But don't expect a thumping bass or exaggerated sound profiles, it's not meant for that. I'd recommend other headsets for those. If you're into Low-fi Hip Hop, Chill mellow music, Jazz, Acoustic music etc. these are insanely good. Great for podcasts as well. But if you're someone who loves to blow the music out at full volume and enjoy some good deep bass / loud Bollywood (I do too from time to time), these aren't the headsets for it. It can be slightly uncomfortable to listen to these at 100% volume for long hours. They're best at 50% so you can relax and work while you're listening to music.

Hope that's as detailed as possible for you to make your decision. :)",2021-07-27,5,19.0,https://amazon.in/AKG-K52-Closed-Back-Headphone-Black/dp/B019EACGSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3AHJEY47Q5NDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019EACGSU,2025-01-12T03:09:43.656436,Negative,0.5203539133071899
